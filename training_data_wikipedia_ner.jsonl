{"prompt": "ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI and released in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 foundational large language models (LLMs) and has been fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning) using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.\nChatGPT launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022, and garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. Its propensity, at times, to confidently provide factually incorrect responses, however, has been identified as a significant drawback. In 2023, following the release of ChatGPT, OpenAI's valuation was estimated at US$29 billion. The advent of the chatbot has increased competition within the space, motivating the creation of Google's Bard and Meta's LLaMA.\nThe original release of ChatGPT was based on GPT-3.5. A version based on GPT-4, the newest OpenAI model, was released on March 14, 2023, and is available for paid subscribers on a limited basis.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " AI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence@@OpenAI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI@@GPT-3.5: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3@@GPT-4: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4@@Google: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google@@LLaMA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "Mario is a character created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. He is the title character of the video game franchise of the same name and the mascot of Japanese video game company Nintendo. Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation. He is an Italian plumber residing in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom, whose adventures generally center on rescuing Princess Peach from the villain Bowser. Mario has access to a variety of power-ups that give him different abilities. Mario's brother is Luigi.\nMario first appeared as the player character of Donkey Kong (1981), a platform game. Miyamoto wanted to use Popeye as the protagonist, but when he could not achieve the licensing rights, he created Mario instead. Miyamoto expected the character to be unpopular and planned to use him for cameo appearances; originally called \"Mr. Video\", he was renamed to Mario after Mario Segale. Mario's clothing and characteristics were themed after the setting of Donkey Kong. He then began to star in the Super Mario series of platform games, beginning with the critically acclaimed Super Mario Bros. in 1985. Since 1992, Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet.\nAfter Super Mario Bros., Mario began to branch off to different genres. These include puzzle games such as Dr. Mario, role-playing games such as Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi, and sports games such as Mario Kart and Mario Tennis. He has appeared in other Nintendo properties, such as in the Super Smash Bros. series of crossover fighting games. Mario has also appeared in various animations, including three series produced by DIC Entertainment (voiced by Lou Albano and later Walker Boone), and was portrayed by Bob Hoskins in the 1993 Super Mario Bros. film. He was voiced by Chris Pratt in the The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nMario is near-unanimously considered to be the most famous character in the video game industry and an established pop culture icon. Mario's likeness has appeared in a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectible items, and people and places have been nicknamed after him. He has also inspired a considerable amount of unofficial media. With more than 750 million units sold worldwide, the overall Mario franchise is the bestselling video game franchise of all time.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Shigeru Miyamoto: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto@@Nintendo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo@@Mushroom Kingdom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom_Kingdom@@Princess Peach: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Peach@@Bowser: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowser@@Luigi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi@@Donkey Kong: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong@@Popeye: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popeye@@Mario Segale: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Segale@@Super Mario: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario@@Charles Martinet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Martinet@@Dr. Mario: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Mario@@Paper Mario: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Mario@@Mario & Luigi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%26_Luigi@@Mario Kart: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart@@Mario Tennis: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Tennis@@DIC Entertainment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIC_Entertainment@@Lou Albano: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Albano@@Walker Boone: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Boone@@Bob Hoskins: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hoskins@@Super Mario Bros. film: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_movie@@Chris Pratt: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pratt@@The Super Mario Bros.

Language models generate probabilities by training on text corpora in one or many languages. Given that languages can be used to express an infinite variety of valid sentences (the property of digital infinity), language modeling faces the problem of assigning non-zero probabilities to linguistically valid sequences that may never be encountered in the training data. Several modelling approaches have been designed to surmount this problem, such as applying the Markov assumption or using neural architectures such as recurrent neural networks or transformers.\nLanguage models are useful for a variety of problems in computational linguistics; from initial applications in speech recognition to ensure nonsensical (i.e. low-probability) word sequences are not predicted, to wider use in machine translation (e.g. scoring candidate translations), natural language generation (generating more human-like text), part-of-speech tagging, parsing, optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, information retrieval, and other applications.\nLanguage models are used in information retrieval in the query likelihood model. There, a separate language model is associated with each document in a collection.

{"prompt": "The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis. It is the first installment in the Matrix film series, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano, and depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix, a simulated reality that intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias \"Neo\", uncovers the truth, he joins a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix.\nThe Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The film popularized terms such as red pill, and introduced a visual effect known as \"bullet time\", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally.\nThe Matrix opened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value, and was a massive success at the box office, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and the fourth highest-grossing film of that year. At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film won all four categories it was nominated for, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing. The film was also the recipient of numerous other accolades, including Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects at the 53rd British Academy Film Awards, and the Wachowskis were awarded Best Director and Best Science Fiction Film at the 26th Saturn Awards. The film is considered to be among the greatest science fiction films of all time, and in 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"The film's success led to two feature film sequels being released in 2003, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, which were also written and directed by the Wachowskis. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and an animated anthology film, The Animatrix, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films.

The 14th and current Dalai Lama is Tenzin Gyatso, who lives in exile as a refugee in India. The Dalai Lama is also considered to be the successor in a line of tulkus who are believed to be incarnations of Avalokite\u015bvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.Since the time of the 5th Dalai Lama in the 17th century, his personage has always been a symbol of unification of the state of Tibet, where he has represented Buddhist values and traditions. The Dalai Lama was an important figure of the Geluk tradition, which was politically and numerically dominant in Central Tibet, but his religious authority went beyond sectarian boundaries. While he had no formal or institutional role in any of the religious traditions, which were headed by their own high lamas, he was a unifying symbol of the Tibetan state, representing Buddhist values and traditions above any specific school. The traditional function of the Dalai Lama as an ecumenical figure, holding together disparate religious and regional groups, has been taken up by the fourteenth Dalai Lama. He has worked to overcome sectarian and other divisions in the exiled community and has become a symbol of Tibetan nationhood for Tibetans both in Tibet and in exile.From 1642 until 1705 and from 1750 to the 1950s, the Dalai Lamas or their regents headed the Tibetan government (or Ganden Phodrang) in Lhasa, which governed all or most of the Tibetan Plateau with varying degrees of autonomy. This Tibetan government enjoyed the patronage and protection of firstly Mongol kings of the Khoshut and Dzungar Khanates (1642\u20131720) and then of the emperors of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1720\u20131912). In 1913, several Tibetan representatives including Agvan Dorzhiev signed a treaty between Tibet and Mongolia, proclaiming mutual recognition and their independence from China. The legitimacy of the treaty and declared independence of Tibet was rejected by both the Republic of China and the current People's Republic of China.

It occupies 650 km2 (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of Southern India. With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 Census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India. With an output of US$74 billion, Hyderabad has the fifth-largest urban economy in India.\nThe Qutb Shahi dynasty's Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda. In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals. In 1724, Asaf Jah I, the Mughal viceroy, declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty, also known as the Nizams. Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahi's from 1769 to 1948. As capital of the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a capital of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956. After the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states with a transitional arrangement scheduled to end in 2024. Since 1956, the city has housed the Rashtrapati Nilayam, the winter office of the president of India.\nRelics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras remain visible today; the Charminar has come to symbolise the city. By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire had declined in the Deccan, and the Nizam's patronage attracted men of letters from various parts of the world. A distinctive culture arose from the amalgamation of local and migrated artisans, with Painting, handicraft, jewellery, literature, dialect and clothing are prominent still today. Through its cuisine, the city is listed as a creative city of gastronomy by UNESCO. The Telugu film industry based in the city was the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures as of 2012.\nUntil the 19th century Hyderabad was known for the pearl industry and was nicknamed the \"City of Pearls\", and was the only trading centre for Golconda diamonds in the world. Many of the city's historical and traditional bazaars remain open. Hyderabad's central location between the Deccan Plateau and the Western Ghats, and industrialisation throughout the 20th century attracted major Indian research, manufacturing, educational and financial institutions. Since the 1990s, the city has emerged as an Indian hub of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. The formation of the special economic zones of Hardware Park and HITEC City, dedicated to information technology, has encouraged leading multinationals to set up operations in Hyderabad.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Urdu: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu@@Indian state: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India@@Telangana: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana@@Andhra Pradesh: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh@@Deccan Plateau: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Plateau@@India: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India@@Hussain Sagar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussain_Sagar@@2011 Census of India: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Census_of_India@@Qutb Shahi dynasty: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_Shahi_dynasty@@Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Quli_Qutb_Shah@@Golconda: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golconda@@Asaf Jah I: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam-ul-Mulk,_Asaf_Jah_I@@Asaf Jahi dynasty: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asaf_Jahi_dynasty@@Nizams: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam_of_Hyderabad@@Hyderabad State: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad_State@@States Reorganisation Act: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_Reorganisation_Act,_1956@@Rashtrapati Nilayam: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtrapati_Nilayam@@Qutb Shahi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_Shahi_dynasty@@Charminar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charminar@@Mughal Empire: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire@@UNESCO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO@@Golconda diamonds: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golconda_diamonds@@Western Ghats: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats@@HITEC City: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITEC_City\n\n^^^^^\n"}

He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London.  In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar.

{"prompt": "Bon Jovi is an American rock band formed in 1983 in Sayreville, New Jersey. It consists of singer Jon Bon Jovi, keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, guitarist Phil X, and bassist Hugh McDonald. Original bassist Alec John Such quit the band in 1994, and longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora left in 2013. The band has been credited with \"[bridging] the gap between heavy metal and pop with style and ease\".In 1984 and 1985, Bon Jovi released their first two albums and their debut single \"Runaway\" managed to crack the Top 40. In 1986, the band achieved widespread success and global recognition with their third album, Slippery When Wet, which sold over 20 million copies and included three Top 10 singles, two of which reached No. 1 (\"You Give Love a Bad Name\" and \"Livin' on a Prayer\") Their fourth album, New Jersey (1988), was also very successful, selling over 10 million copies and featuring five Top 10 singles (a record for a glam metal album), two of which reached No. 1 (\"Bad Medicine\" and \"I'll Be There for You\"). After the band toured and recorded extensively during the late 1980s, culminating in the 1988\u20131990 New Jersey Tour, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora released successful solo albums in 1990 and 1991, respectively.\nIn 1992, the band returned with the double-platinum Keep the Faith. This was followed by their biggest-selling and longest-charting single \"Always\" (1994) and the album These Days (1995), which proved to be a bigger success in Europe than in the United States, producing four Top Ten singles in the United Kingdom. Following a second hiatus, their 2000 album Crush, particularly the lead single, \"It's My Life\", successfully introduced the band to a younger audience, and the band considered this their comeback album. The band followed up with Bounce in 2002.  The platinum albums Have a Nice Day (2005)  and Lost Highway (2007) saw the band incorporate elements of country music into some of the songs, including the 2006 single \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\", which won the band a Grammy Award and became the first single by a rock band to reach No. 1 on the country charts. The Circle (2009) marked a return to the band's rock sound. The band also enjoyed great success touring, with both the 2005\u20132006 Have a Nice Day Tour and 2007\u20132008 Lost Highway Tour ranking among the Top 20 highest-grossing concert tours of the 2000s. After recording and releasing Because We Can in 2013, lead guitarist Richie Sambora left the band just before an April concert during the supporting tour to spend more time with his family. The band released their first studio album without Sambora, Burning Bridges, in 2015 and the follow-up album This House Is Not For Sale in 2016, the tour for which encompassed 2017\u20132019. Their most recent album 2020 (2020) was re-worked to include songs inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and George Floyd protests; its  supporting tour was delayed to 2022.\nBon Jovi has released 15 studio albums, five compilations and three live albums. They have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling American rock bands, and performed more than 2,700 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans. Bon Jovi was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. The band received the Award of Merit at the American Music Awards in 2004, and Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Sayreville, New Jersey: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayreville,_New_Jersey@@Jon Bon Jovi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bon_Jovi@@David Bryan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bryan@@Tico Torres: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tico_Torres@@Phil X: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_X@@Alec John Such: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_John_Such@@Richie Sambora: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Sambora@@Slippery When Wet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_When_Wet@@You Give Love a Bad Name: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Give_Love_a_Bad_Name@@Livin' on a Prayer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livin%27_on_a_Prayer@@New Jersey Tour: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Syndicate_Tour@@Keep the Faith: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_the_Faith@@Who Says You Can't Go Home: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Says_You_Can%27t_Go_Home@@Grammy Award: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards@@Have a Nice Day Tour: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_a_Nice_Day_Tour@@Lost Highway Tour: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Highway_Tour@@Because We Can: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Because_We_Can@@COVID-19 pandemic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic@@George Floyd protests: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests@@UK Music Hall of Fame: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Music_Hall_of_Fame@@Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame@@American Music Awards: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Music_Awards@@Songwriters Hall of Fame: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ( GA(H)N-dee, Gujarati: [\u02c8mo\u0266\u0259nd\u0251s \u02c8k\u0259\u027e\u0259mt\u0283\u0259nd \u02c8\u0261\u0251\u0303d\u02b1i]; 2 October 1869 \u2013 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed  nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mah\u0101tm\u0101 (Sanskrit: \"great-souled\", \"venerable\"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.\nAssuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.\nGandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these, begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan, which the Indian government had been resisting. Although the Government of India relented, as did the religious rioters, the belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims, spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948.Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered the Father of the Nation in India and is commonly called Bapu (Gujarati endearment for 'father', 'papa').\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Karamchand Gandhi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamchand_Gandhi@@India: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India@@Mah\u0101tm\u0101: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma@@Sanskrit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit@@South Africa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa@@Hindu: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus@@Gujarat: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat@@Gandhi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi@@Inner Temple: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Temple@@London: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London@@Indian National Congress: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress@@Salt March: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_March@@British India: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidencies_and_provinces_of_British_India@@Bengal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal@@Delhi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi@@Government of India: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India@@Nathuram Godse: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathuram_Godse@@Pune: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune@@Gandhi Jayanti: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhi_Jayanti@@Nonviolence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence@@Father of the Nation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_of_the_Nation\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Satoru Iwata (Japanese: \u5ca9\u7530 \u8061, Hepburn: Iwata Satoru, December 6, 1959 \u2013 July 11, 2015) was a Japanese businessman, video game programmer, video game designer, and producer. He was the fourth president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Nintendo from 2002 until his death in 2015. He was a major contributor in broadening the appeal of video games by focusing on novel and entertaining games rather than top-of-the-line hardware.\nBorn in Sapporo, Iwata expressed interest in video games from an early age and created his first simple game while in high school. He majored in computer science at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. In 1980, he joined the game developer HAL Laboratory while attending the university. At HAL, he worked as a programmer and closely collaborated with Nintendo, producing his first commercial game in 1983. Games to which he contributed include EarthBound and many games in the Kirby series. Following a downturn and near-bankruptcy, Iwata became the president of HAL in 1993 at the insistence of Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi and brought financial stability. In the following years, he worked in the development of the Pok\u00e9mon and Super Smash Bros. series. Iwata joined Nintendo as the head of its corporate planning division in 2000.\nNintendo saw growth under Iwata and, when Yamauchi retired, he became the company's president in May 2002. Under Iwata's direction, Nintendo developed the Nintendo DS and Wii game consoles, helping the company achieve financial success. As a self-declared gamer, he focused on expanding the appeal of video games across demographics through a \"blue ocean\" business strategy. Nintendo attained record profits by 2009, and Barron's placed Iwata among the top 30 CEOs worldwide. Iwata expanded his strategy by defining a quality-of-life product line for the Wii that evolved into a ten-year strategy to create standalone products. Later hardware such as the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U proved far less profitable than the Wii, and Nintendo's net sales fell by two thirds from 2009 to 2012; the company saw its first operating losses in 30 years during this time. Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and 2014. In 2015, after several years of refusal, Iwata put a portion of Nintendo's focus into the rapidly growing mobile game market; a landmark partnership with mobile provider DeNA was established that March. Throughout his career, Iwata built a relationship with Nintendo fans through social media and his regular appearances in Iwata Asks and Nintendo Direct, becoming the public face of the company.\nIn June 2014, a tumor in Iwata's bile duct was discovered during a routine physical exam. It was removed, and Iwata returned to work in October of that year. The problem resurfaced in 2015, and Iwata died at the age of 55 from its complications on July 11. Members of the gaming industry and fans alike offered tributes through public announcements and social media, and fans worldwide established temporary memorials. Iwata was posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards and the 2016 D.I.C.E. Awards.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Nintendo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo@@Sapporo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapporo@@Tokyo Institute of Technology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Institute_of_Technology@@HAL Laboratory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_Laboratory@@EarthBound: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound@@Kirby series: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_(series)@@Hiroshi Yamauchi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Yamauchi@@Nintendo DS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS@@Wii: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii@@Nintendo 3DS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS@@Wii U: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U@@DeNA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeNA@@Iwata Asks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Iwata_Asks_interviews@@Nintendo Direct: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Direct@@Golden Joystick Awards: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Joystick_Awards@@D.I.C.E.

{"prompt": "Cops (stylized as COPS) is an American television documentary reality legal programming television series that is currently in its 35th season. It is produced by Langley Productions. It premiered on the Fox network on March 11, 1989. The series, known for chronicling the lives of police officers, follows city police officers and sheriff's deputies, sometimes backed up by state police or other state agencies, during patrol, calls for service, and other police activities including prostitution and narcotic stings, and occasionally the serving of search/arrest warrants at criminal residences. Some episodes have also featured federal agencies. The show's formula follows the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 convention, which does not consist of any narration, scripted dialogue or incidental music/added sound effects, depending entirely on the commentary of the officers and on the actions of the people with whom they come into contact, giving the audience a fly on the wall point of view. Each episode typically consists of three self-contained segments which often ended with one or more arrests.\nIt is one of the longest-running television shows in the United States and, in May 2011, it became the longest-running show on Fox (since then, its duration has been surpassed by the duration of The Simpsons). It also became the longest running live action series on Fox, after America's Most Wanted was canceled after 23 years (that show's host, John Walsh, also appeared on Cops many times). In 2013, the program moved to Spike TV, now known as Paramount Network.In late 2007, during the premiere of its 20th season, episodes of Cops began broadcasting in widescreen, though not in high definition. In June 2020, Paramount Network pulled the show from its schedule in response to George Floyd protests following his death while under arrest by the Minneapolis Police Department, and announced its cancellation days later. The show remains in production for its international and overseas partners, and began to film anew in Spokane County, Washington, with its sheriff's department in October 2020. In September 2021, it was announced that Fox Nation picked up the show. The 33rd season premiered on October 1, 2021. The show's 34th season premiered on September 30, 2022.

{"prompt": "Improvisational theatre, often called improvisation or improv, is the form of theatre, often comedy, in which most or all of what is performed is unplanned or unscripted, created spontaneously by the performers.

It is sometimes used in film and television, both to develop characters and scripts and occasionally as part of the final product.\nImprovisational techniques are often used extensively in drama programs to train actors for stage, film, and television and can be an important part of the rehearsal process. However, the skills and processes of improvisation are also used outside the context of performing arts. This practice, known as applied improvisation, is used in classrooms as an educational tool and in businesses as a way to develop communication skills, creative problem solving, and supportive team-work abilities that are used by improvisational, ensemble players. It is sometimes used in psychotherapy as a tool to gain insight into a person's thoughts, feelings, and relationships.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " \n\n^^^^^\n"}

This \"militant\" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to question.\nSatire is found in many artistic forms of expression, including internet memes, literature, plays, commentary, music, film and television shows, and media such as lyrics.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Northrop Frye: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Frye\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is an anxiety disorder characterized by sentiments of fear and anxiety in social situations, causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function in at least some aspects of daily life.:\u200a15\u200a These fears can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny from others. Individuals with social anxiety disorder fear negative evaluations from other people.\nPhysical symptoms often include excessive blushing, excess sweating, trembling, palpitations, and nausea. Stammering may be present, along with rapid speech. Panic attacks can also occur under intense fear and discomfort. Some affected individuals may use alcohol or other drugs to reduce fears and inhibitions at social events. It is common for those with social phobia to self-medicate in this fashion, especially if they are undiagnosed, untreated, or both; this can lead to alcohol use disorder, eating disorders or other kinds of substance use disorders. SAD is sometimes referred to as an illness of lost opportunities where \"individuals make major life choices to accommodate their illness\". According to ICD-10 guidelines, the main diagnostic criteria of social phobia are fear of being the focus of attention, or fear of behaving in a way that will be embarrassing or humiliating, avoidance and anxiety symptoms. Standardized rating scales can be used to screen for social anxiety disorder and measure the severity of anxiety.\nThe first line of treatment for social anxiety disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Medications such as SSRIs are effective for social phobia, especially paroxetine. CBT is effective in treating this disorder, whether delivered individually or in a group setting. The cognitive and behavioral components seek to change thought patterns and physical reactions to anxiety-inducing situations. The attention given to social anxiety disorder has significantly increased since 1999 with the approval and marketing of drugs for its treatment. Prescribed medications include several classes of antidepressants: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Other commonly used medications include beta blockers and benzodiazepines.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Social anxiety: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety@@ICD-10: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Musical theatre is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting and dance. The story and emotional content of a musical \u2013 humor, pathos, love, anger \u2013 are communicated through words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals.\nAlthough music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America. These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan at the turn of the 20th century. The Princess Theatre musicals (1915\u20131918) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as Show Boat (1927), Of Thee I Sing (1931) and Oklahoma! (1943). Some of the most famous musicals through the decades that followed include\nMy Fair Lady (1956), The Fantasticks (1960), Hair (1967), A Chorus Line (1975), Les Mis\u00e9rables (1985), The Phantom of the Opera (1986), Rent (1996), The Producers (2001), Wicked (2003) and Hamilton (2015).\nMusicals are performed around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget Broadway or West End productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller venues, such as off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, regional theatre, fringe theatre, or community theatre productions, or on tour. Musicals are often presented by amateur and school groups in churches, schools and other performance spaces.

{"prompt": "Music hall is a type of British theatrical entertainment that was popular from the early Victorian era, beginning around 1850. It faded away after 1918 as the halls rebranded their entertainment as variety. Perceptions of a distinction in Britain between bold and scandalous Music Hall and subsequent, more respectable Variety differ. Music hall involved a mixture of popular songs, comedy, speciality acts, and variety entertainment. The term is derived from a type of theatre or venue in which such entertainment took place. In North America vaudeville was in some ways analogous to British music hall, featuring rousing songs and comic acts.\nOriginating in saloon bars within public houses during the 1830s, music hall entertainment became increasingly popular with audiences. So much so, that during the 1850s some public houses were demolished, and specialised music hall theatres developed in their place. These theatres were designed chiefly so that people could consume food and alcohol and smoke tobacco in the auditorium while the entertainment took place, with the cheapest seats located in the gallery. This differed from the conventional type of theatre, which seats the audience in stalls with a separate bar-room. Major music halls were based around London. Early examples included: the Canterbury Music Hall in Lambeth, Wilton's Music Hall in Tower Hamlets, and The Middlesex in Drury Lane, otherwise known as the Old Mo.\nBy the mid-19th century, the halls cried out for many new and catchy songs. As a result, professional songwriters were enlisted to provide the music for a plethora of star performers, such as Marie Lloyd, Dan Leno, Little Tich, and George Leybourne. All manner of other entertainment was performed: male and female impersonators, lions comiques, mime artists and impressionists, trampoline acts, and comic pianists (such as John Orlando Parry and George Grossmith) were just a few of the many types of entertainments the audiences could expect to find over the next forty years.The Music Hall Strike of 1907 was an important industrial conflict. It was a dispute between artists and stage hands on one hand, and theatre managers on the other. The halls had recovered by the start of the First World War and were used to stage charity events in aid of the war effort. Music hall entertainment continued after the war, but became less popular due to upcoming jazz, swing, and big-band dance music acts. Licensing restrictions had also changed, and drinking was banned from the auditorium. A new type of music hall entertainment had arrived, in the form of variety, and many music hall performers failed to make the transition. They were deemed old-fashioned, and with the closure of many halls, music hall entertainment ceased and modern-day variety began.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Victorian era: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era@@Canterbury Music Hall: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Music_Hall@@Lambeth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambeth@@Wilton's Music Hall: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilton%27s_Music_Hall@@Tower Hamlets: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets@@Drury Lane: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drury_Lane@@Marie Lloyd: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Lloyd@@Dan Leno: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Leno@@Little Tich: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Tich@@George Leybourne: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Leybourne@@John Orlando Parry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Orlando_Parry@@George Grossmith: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Grossmith@@Music Hall Strike of 1907: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Hall_Strike_of_1907\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Biography is an American documentary television series and media franchise created in the 1960s by David L. Wolper and owned by A&E Networks since 1987. Each episode depicts the life of a notable person with narration, on-camera interviews, photographs, and stock footage. The show originally ran in syndication in 1962\u20131964,  and in 1979, on A&E from 1987 to 2006, and on The Biography Channel (later Bio, now FYI) from 2006 to 2012. After a five-year hiatus, the franchise was relaunched in 2017. Over the years, the Biography media franchise has expanded domestically and internationally, spinning off several cable television channels, a website, a children's program, a line of books and records, and a series of made-for-TV movies, specials, and miniseries, among other media properties. Biography has won a Peabody Award (1962) and three Emmy Awards (1997, 1999, 2002).\nBiography began as an early 1960s syndicated television series produced by David Wolper and narrated by Mike Wallace. It won a Peabody Award, launched Wallace's journalism career, and became a standard in biography films, widely shown in classrooms. After a one-year revival in 1979, the show returned on A&E Networks in 1987. In 1990, A&E began producing new episodes, and expanded the show into a multimedia franchise. By the turn of the century, Biography became A&E's \"flagship\" program, winning three Emmy Awards, growing from one night per week to seven, and spawning its own cable television channel, several spin-off shows, a website, made-for-TV movies, mini-series, books, audio books, records, and even a board game. The show's ratings eventually slipped and its airtime was reduced to one night per week, then exclusive to The Biography Channel (now FYI). Production of new episodes ceased in 2011 and Biography was almost entirely off the air by 2012. In 2017, A&E relaunched the Biography franchise with a series of TV specials and miniseries.

{"prompt": "A nanny is a person who provides child care. Typically, this care is given within the children's family setting. Throughout history, nannies were usually servants in large households and reported directly to the lady of the house. Today, modern nannies, like other domestic workers, may live in or out of the house, depending on their circumstances and those of their employers. Some employment agencies specialize in providing nannies, as there are families that specifically seek them and may make them a part of the household.\nNannies differ slightly from other child care providers. A childminder works out of their own home, operating as a small business. In America, childminders are often advertised as a daycare. Depending on the country the childminder or daycare is in, government registration may or may not be required. Within the UK, a childminder must be Ofsted registered, hold a current paediatric first aid qualification, public liability insurance and follow the EYFS. A mother's helper is someone who may live in or out of the household, and assists the person of the house with general chores as well as caring for the children. The term au pair usually refers to a young person, who comes from abroad to live with the host family and learn the local culture and language, while helping care for the children. A governess concentrates on educating children inside their own home, and a kindergarten or schoolteacher does the same, but in a school environment.\nEven though there are no legal requirements to be considered a nanny, families may require a background check and a CPR certification. Families may also look for other special skills in a nanny, such as being bilingual or having early childhood development coursework done. Nannies help play a key role in a child's development by providing care.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Nannies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanny@@Ofsted: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofsted\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Feminism is a range of socio-political movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Feminism holds the position that societies prioritize the male point of view and that women are treated unjustly in these societies. Efforts to change this include fighting against gender stereotypes and improving educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women.\nFeminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women's rights, including the right to vote, run for public office, work, earn equal pay, own property, receive education, enter contracts, have equal rights within marriage, and maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to contraception, legal abortions, and social integration and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in female dress standards and acceptable physical activities for females have also been part of feminist movements.Many scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender-neutral language, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims, because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles. Feminist theory, which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experiences; feminist theorists have developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years, representing different viewpoints and political aims. Traditionally, since the 19th century, first-wave liberal feminism, which sought political and legal equality through reforms within a liberal democratic framework, was contrasted with labour-based proletarian women's movements that over time developed into socialist and Marxist feminism based on class struggle theory. Since the 1960s, both of these traditions are also contrasted with the radical feminism that arose from the radical wing of second-wave feminism and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate male supremacy; together liberal, socialist and radical feminism are sometimes called the \"Big Three\" schools of feminist thought.Since the late 20th century, many newer forms of feminism have emerged. Some forms, such as white feminism, have been criticized as taking into account only white, middle class, college-educated, heterosexual, or cisgender perspectives. These criticisms have led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism, such as black feminism and intersectional feminism. Some feminists have argued that feminism often promotes misandry and the elevation of women's interests above men's, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Feminist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism@@Feminists: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism@@Feminist theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_theory@@Marxist feminism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_feminism\n\n^^^^^\n"}

This viewpoint is denied by most sociologists, anthropologists and scholars of gender studies who counter that misandry is not at all established as a cultural institution, nor is it equivalent to misogyny which is many times more prevalent in scope, far more deeply rooted in society, and more severe in its consequences. Scholars criticize MRAs for promoting a false equivalence between misandry and misogyny.:\u200a132\u200a The modern activism around misandry represents an antifeminist backlash, promoted by marginalized men.Misandry can be racialized.

Across cultures, most people are heterosexual, and heterosexual activity is by far the most common type of sexual activity.Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, and do not view it as a choice. Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support, scientists favor biologically-based theories. There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males.The term heterosexual or heterosexuality is usually applied to humans, but heterosexual behavior is observed in all other mammals and in other animals, as it is necessary for sexual reproduction.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " \n\n^^^^^\n"}

The first Premier Boxing Champions card was broadcast by NBC on March 7, 2015, and the promotion reached deals with an array of other broadcasters, with brokered cards scheduled across all four of the major television networks in the United States (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC) and their affiliated sports-oriented cable networks (ESPN, CBS Sports Network, FS1, and NBCSN, respectively), as well as on outlets such as Spike and Bounce TV. \nIn parallel with the focus on major cards on broadcast television, the events initially featured a more elaborate in-arena staging than other boxing events, featuring an entrance stage, and a circular marquee and jumbotron suspended above the ring. The telecasts also employed various technologies, including a 360-degree camera rig above the ring, and sensor-equipped gloves and shorts for gathering additional statistics. However, these features were phased out from later events. By 2018, PBC had established long-term deals with Fox Sports and Showtime,  with the networks paying traditional rights fees, and holding the rights to produce PBC pay-per-view events. \nAlthough it promotes the media rights of its associated events, PBC is not considered to be a promoter, in compliance with the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act (which forbids manager from also serving as a promoter).

Golden Boy Promotions and Top Rank both filed lawsuits against Haymon and the investors of PBC, arguing that through PBC and other internal intricacies, Haymon was serving as both a manager and promoter\u2014actions which are forbidden under the Ali Act. Additionally, the two promoters claimed violations of antitrust law, with Top Rank in particular claiming that Haymon was trying to effectively monopolize professional boxing in the United States by consolidating boxers with overpaid contracts, venue bookings, the events themselves, and broadcast rights under his ownership.

{"prompt": "Sustainability is a social goal about the ability of people to co-exist on Earth over a long time. Specific definitions of this term are difficult to agree on. They have varied with literature, context, and time. Experts often describe sustainability as having three dimensions (or pillars). These are environmental, economic, and social. Many publications state that the environmental dimension is the most important. So in everyday use, sustainability often focuses on countering major environmental problems. These include climate change and loss of biodiversity. They also include loss of ecosystem services, land degradation, and air and water pollution. The idea of sustainability can guide decisions at the global, national, and individual levels (e.g. sustainable living). A related concept is sustainable development, and the terms are often used to mean the same thing. UNESCO distinguishes the two like this: \"Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it.\"The economic dimension of sustainability is controversial. Scholars have discussed this aspect under the concept of \"weak and strong sustainability\". For example, there will always be tension between the ideas of \"welfare and prosperity for all\" and environmental conservation. So trade-offs are necessary. Approaches that decouple economic growth from environmental deterioration would be desirable. But they are difficult to carry out. Measuring sustainability is difficult. Indicators consider environmental, social and economic domains. The metrics are evolving. They include certification systems, types of corporate accounting, and types of index. It is necessary to address many barriers to sustainability to make a sustainability transition possible.:\u200a34\u200a Some barriers arise from nature and its complexity. Other barriers are extrinsic to the concept of sustainability. For example they can result from the dominant institutional frameworks in countries.\nThere are many approaches people can take to transition to environmental sustainability. These include maintaining ecosystem services, reducing food waste, and promoting dietary shifts towards plant-based foods. Another is reducing population growth by cutting fertility rates. Others are promoting new green technologies, and adopting renewable energy sources while phasing out subsidies to fossil fuels. The United Nations agreed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. These set a global agenda for sustainable development, with a deadline of 2030.\nOne option to overcome barriers to sustainable development is to decouple economic growth from environmental conservation. This means using fewer resources per unit of output even while growing the economy. This reduces the environmental impact of economic growth such as pollution. Doing this is difficult. Some experts say there is no evidence that it is happening at the required scale. Global issues are difficult to tackle as they need global solutions. Existing global organizations such as the UN and WTO are inefficient in enforcing current global regulations. One reason for this is the lack of suitable sanctioning mechanisms.:\u200a135\u2013145\u200a Governments are not the only sources of action for sustainability.

For example they can result from the dominant institutional frameworks in countries.\nThere are many approaches people can take to transition to environmental sustainability. These include maintaining ecosystem services, reducing food waste, and promoting dietary shifts towards plant-based foods. Another is reducing population growth by cutting fertility rates. Others are promoting new green technologies, and adopting renewable energy sources while phasing out subsidies to fossil fuels. The United Nations agreed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. These set a global agenda for sustainable development, with a deadline of 2030.\nOne option to overcome barriers to sustainable development is to decouple economic growth from environmental conservation. This means using fewer resources per unit of output even while growing the economy. This reduces the environmental impact of economic growth such as pollution. Doing this is difficult. Some experts say there is no evidence that it is happening at the required scale. Global issues are difficult to tackle as they need global solutions. Existing global organizations such as the UN and WTO are inefficient in enforcing current global regulations. One reason for this is the lack of suitable sanctioning mechanisms.:\u200a135\u2013145\u200a Governments are not the only sources of action for sustainability. Business groups have tried to integrate ecological concerns with economic activity. Religious leaders have stressed the need for caring for nature and environmental stability. Individuals can also live in a more sustainable way.The concept of sustainability has faced various criticisms. One is that the concept is vague and only a buzzword. Another is that sustainability might be an impossible goal. Some experts have pointed out that \"no country is delivering what its citizens need without transgressing the biophysical planetary boundaries\".:\u200a11\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " UNESCO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO@@United Nations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations@@Sustainable Development Goals: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "Environmental psychology is a branch of psychology that explores the relationship between humans and the external world. It examines the way in which the natural environment and our built environments shape us as individuals. Environmental Psychology emphasizes how humans change the environment and how the environment changes humans' experiences and behaviors. The field defines the term environment broadly, encompassing natural environments, social settings, built environments, learning environments, and informational environments. According to an article on APA Psychnet, environmental psychology is when a person thinks of a plan, travels to a certain place, and follows through with the plan throughout their behavior.Environmental psychology was not fully recognized as its own field until the late 1960s when scientists began to question the tie between human behavior and our natural and built environments. Since its conception, the field has been committed to the development of a discipline that is both value oriented and problem oriented, prioritizing research aimed at solving complex environmental problems in the pursuit of individual well-being within a larger society. When solving problems involving human-environment interactions, whether global or local, one must have a model of human nature that predicts the environmental conditions under which humans will respond well. This model can help design, manage, protect and/or restore environments that enhance reasonable behavior, predict the likely outcomes when these conditions are not met, and diagnose problem situations. The field develops such a model of human nature while retaining a broad and inherently multidisciplinary focus. It explores such dissimilar issues as common property resource management, wayfinding in complex settings, the effect of environmental stress on human performance, the characteristics of restorative environments, human information processing, and the promotion of durable conservation behavior. Lately, alongside the increased focus on climate change in society and the social sciences and the re-emergence of limits-to-growth concerns, there has been an increased focus on environmental sustainability issues within the field.This multidisciplinary paradigm has not only characterized the dynamic for which environmental psychology is expected to develop, but it has also been the catalyst in attracting other schools of knowledge in its pursuit, aside from research psychologists. Geographers, economists, landscape architects, policy-makers, sociologists, anthropologists, educators, and product developers all have discovered and participated in this field.Although \"environmental psychology\" is arguably the best-known and most comprehensive description of the field, it is also known as human factors science, cognitive ergonomics, ecological psychology, ecopsychology, environment\u2013behavior studies, and person\u2013environment studies. Closely related fields include architectural psychology, socio-architecture, behavioral geography, environmental sociology, social ecology, and environmental design research.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Psychology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology\n\n^^^^^\n"}

The term political ecology is sometimes used in academic circles, but it has come to represent an interdisciplinary field of study as the academic discipline offers wide-ranging studies integrating ecological social sciences with political economy in topics such as degradation and marginalization, environmental conflict, conservation and control and environmental identities and social movements.Supporters of green politics share many ideas with the conservation, environmental, feminist and peace movements. In addition to democracy and ecological issues, green politics is concerned with civil liberties, social justice, nonviolence, sometimes variants of localism and tends to support social progressivism. Green party platforms are largely considered left in the political spectrum. The green ideology has connections with various other ecocentric political ideologies, including ecofeminism, eco-socialism and green anarchism, but to what extent these can be seen as forms of green politics is a matter of debate.

{"prompt": "Ecosystem-based management is an environmental management approach that recognizes the full array of interactions within an ecosystem, including humans, rather than considering single issues, species, or ecosystem services in isolation. It can be applied to studies in the terrestrial and aquatic environments with challenges being attributed to both. In the marine realm, they are highly challenging to quantify due to highly migratory species as well as rapidly changing environmental and anthropogenic factors that can alter the habitat rather quickly. To be able to manage fisheries efficiently and effectively it has become increasingly more pertinent to understand not only the biological aspects of the species being studied, but also the environmental variables they are experiencing. Population abundance and structure, life history traits, competition with other species, where the stock is in the local food web, tidal fluctuations, salinity patterns and anthropogenic influences are among the variables that must be taken into account to fully understand the implementation of a \"ecosystem-based management\" approach. Interest in ecosystem-based management in the marine realm has developed more recently, in response to increasing recognition of the declining state of fisheries and ocean ecosystems. However, due to a lack of a clear definition and the diversity involved with the environment, the implementation has been lagging. In freshwater lake ecosystems, it has been shown that ecosystem-based habitat management is more effective for enhancing fish populations than management alternatives.Terrestrial ecosystem-based management (often referred to as ecosystem management) came into its own during the conflicts over endangered species protection (particularly the northern spotted owl), land conservation, and water, grazing and timber rights in the western United States in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Ecosystem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Rain gardens, also called bioretention facilities, are one of a variety of practices designed to increase rain runoff reabsorption by the soil. They can also be used to treat polluted stormwater runoff. Rain gardens are designed landscape sites that reduce the flow rate, total quantity, and pollutant load of runoff from impervious urban areas like roofs, driveways, walkways, parking lots, and compacted lawn areas. Rain gardens rely on plants and natural or engineered soil medium to retain  stormwater and increase the lag time of infiltration, while remediating and filtering pollutants carried by urban runoff. Rain gardens provide a method to reuse and optimize any rain that falls, reducing or avoiding the need for additional irrigation. A benefit of planting rain gardens is the consequential decrease in ambient air and water temperature, a mitigation that is especially effective in urban areas containing an abundance of impervious surfaces that absorb heat in a phenomenon known as the heat-island effect.Rain garden plantings commonly include wetland edge vegetation, such as wildflowers, sedges, rushes, ferns, shrubs and small trees. These plants take up nutrients and water that flow into the rain garden, and they release water vapor back to the atmosphere through the process of transpiration. Deep plant roots also create additional channels for stormwater to filter into the ground. Root systems enhance infiltration, maintain or even augment soil permeability, provide moisture redistribution, and sustain diverse microbial populations involved in biofiltration. Microbes help to break down organic compounds (including some pollutants) and remove nitrogen.\nRain gardens are beneficial for many reasons; they improve water quality by filtering runoff, provide localized flood control, create aesthetic landscaping sites, and provide diverse planting opportunities. They also encourage wildlife and biodiversity, tie together buildings and their surrounding environments in integrated and environmentally advantageous ways. Rain gardens can improve water quality in nearby bodies of water and recharge depleted groundwater supply. Rain gardens also reduce the amount of polluted runoff that enters the storm sewer system, which discharges directly to surface waters and causes erosion, water pollution and flooding.

Stored water may be used for watering gardens, agriculture, flushing toilets, in washing machines, washing cars, and also for drinking, especially when other water supplies are unavailable, expensive, or of poor quality, and when adequate care is taken that the water is not contaminated and is adequately filtered.\nUnderground rainwater tanks can also be used for retention of stormwater for release at a later time and offer a variety of benefits. In arid climates, rain barrels are often used to store water during the rainy season for use during dryer periods.\nRainwater tanks may have a high (perceived) initial cost. However, many homes use small scale rain barrels to harvest minute quantities of water for landscaping/gardening applications rather than as a potable water surrogate.

Bioaccumulation, for example in fish, can be predicted by models. Hypothesis for molecular size cutoff criteria for use as bioaccumulation potential indicators are not supported by data. Biotransformation can strongly modify bioaccumulation of chemicals in an organism.Toxicity induced by metals is associated with bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Storage or uptake of metals faster than the rate at which an organism metabolizes and excretes lead to the accumulation of that metal. The presence of various chemicals and harmful substances in the environment can be analyzed and assessed with a proper knowledge on bioaccumulation helping with chemical control and usage.Uptake of chemicals by an organism can take place by breathing, absorbing through skin or swallowing. When the concentration of a chemical is higher within the organism compared to its surroundings (air or water), it is referred to as bioconcentration. Biomagnification is another process related to bioaccumulation as the concentration of the chemical or metal increases as it moves up from one trophic level to another.

Raunki\u00e6r described this phenomenon as his \"law of frequency\" in 1918, in which he recognized that in communities with a single species accounting for most of the biomass, species diversity was often lower.\nUnderstandably, biologists expect to see more profound effects from those species greater in number. First formalized as the mass ratio hypothesis in a 1998 paper by English ecologist J. Philip Grime, ecologically dominant species are predicted to have overwhelming effects on ecosystem function and ecological processes due to their relatively high biomass and ubiquity.Most ecological communities are defined by their dominant species.In many examples of wet woodland in western Europe, the dominant tree is alder (Alnus glutinosa).\nIn tallgrass prairies of Northeastern Kansas, the dominant grass is (Andropogon gerardii).\nIn temperate bogs, the dominant vegetation is usually species of Sphagnum moss.\nTidal swamps in the tropics are usually dominated by species of mangrove (Rhizophoraceae).\nSome Arctic sea floor communities are dominated by brittle stars.\nExposed rocky shorelines are dominated by sessile organisms such as barnacles and limpets.\nThe turtle ant (Cephalotes pusillus), is thought to dominant arboreal ant communities in the Brazillian savannah.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Christen C.

{"prompt": "Ascendency or ascendancy is a quantitative attribute of an ecosystem, defined as a function of the ecosystem's trophic network.  Ascendency is derived using mathematical tools from information theory.  It is intended to capture in a single index the ability of an ecosystem to prevail against disturbance by virtue of its combined organization and size.\nOne way of depicting ascendency is to regard it as \"organized power\", because the index represents the magnitude of the power that is flowing within the system towards particular ends, as distinct from power that is dissipated naturally. Almost half a century earlier, Alfred J. Lotka (1922) had suggested that a system's capacity to prevail in evolution was related to its ability to capture useful power. Ascendency can thus be regarded as a refinement of Lotka's supposition that also takes into account how power is actually being channeled within a system.\nIn mathematical terms, ascendency is the product of the aggregate amount of material or energy being transferred in an ecosystem times the coherency with which the outputs from the members of the system relate to the set of inputs to the same components (Ulanowicz 1986).  Coherence is gauged by the average mutual information shared between inputs and outputs (Rutledge et al. 1976).\nOriginally, it was thought that ecosystems increase uniformly in ascendency as they developed, but subsequent empirical observation has suggested that all sustainable ecosystems are confined to a narrow \"window of vitality\" (Ulanowicz 2002). Systems with relative values of ascendency plotting below the window tend to fall apart due to lack of significant internal constraints, whereas systems above the window tend to be so \"brittle\" that they become vulnerable to external perturbations.\nSensitivity analysis on the components of the ascendency reveals the controlling transfers within the system in the sense of Liebig (Ulanowicz and Baird 1999). That is, ascendency can be used to identify which resource is limiting the functioning of each component of the ecosystem.\nIt is thought that autocatalytic feedback is the primary route by which systems increase and maintain their ascendencies (Ulanowicz 1997.)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Alfred J.

{"prompt": "Intertidal ecology is the study of intertidal ecosystems, where organisms live between the low and high tide lines. At low tide, the intertidal is exposed whereas at high tide, the intertidal is underwater. Intertidal ecologists therefore study the interactions between intertidal organisms and their environment, as well as between different species of intertidal organisms within a particular intertidal community. The most important environmental and species interactions may vary based on the type of intertidal community being studied, the broadest of classifications being based on substrates\u2014rocky shore and soft bottom communities.Organisms living in this zone have a highly variable and often hostile environment, and have evolved various adaptations to cope with and even exploit these conditions. One easily visible feature of intertidal communities is vertical zonation, where the community is divided into distinct vertical bands of specific species going up the shore. Species ability to cope with abiotic factors associated with emersion stress, such as desiccation determines their upper limits, while biotic interactions e.g.competition with other species sets their lower limits.Intertidal regions are utilized by humans for food and recreation, but anthropogenic actions also have major impacts, with overexploitation, invasive species and climate change being among the problems faced by intertidal communities.

It seeks understanding through the study of the properties of the system as a whole; Kevin Gaston and Tim Blackburn make the analogy to seeing the forest for the trees.Macroecology examines how global development in climate change affect wildlife populations. Classic ecological questions amenable to study through the techniques of macroecology include questions of species richness, latitudinal gradients in species diversity, the species-area curve, range size, body size, and species abundance.

In this approach, physiological, anatomical, and life history characteristics of the species are emphasized. The term \"function\" is used to emphasize certain physiological processes rather than discrete properties, describe an organism's role in a trophic system, or illustrate the effects of natural selective processes on an organism. This sub-discipline of ecology represents the crossroads between ecological patterns and the processes and mechanisms that underlie them. It focuses on traits represented in large number of species and can be measured in two ways \u2013 the first being screening, which involves measuring a trait across a number of species, and the second being empiricism, which provides quantitative relationships for the traits measured in screening. Functional ecology often emphasizes an integrative approach, using organism traits and activities to understand community dynamics and ecosystem processes, particularly in response to the rapid global changes occurring in earth's environment.\nFunctional ecology sits at the nexus of several disparate disciplines and serves as the unifying principle between evolutionary ecology, evolutionary biology, genetics and genomics, and traditional ecological studies.

{"prompt": "In a multicellular organism, an organ is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function. In the hierarchy of life, an organ lies between tissue and an organ system. Tissues are formed from same type cells to act together in a function. Tissues of different types combine to form an organ which has a specific function. The intestinal wall for example is formed by epithelial tissue and smooth muscle tissue. Two or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a biological system or body system.\nAn organ's tissues can be broadly categorized as parenchyma, the functional tissue, and stroma, the structural tissue with supportive, connective, or ancillary functions. For example, the gland's tissue that makes the hormones is the parenchyma, whereas the stroma includes the nerves that innervate the parenchyma, the blood vessels that oxygenate and nourish it and carry away its metabolic wastes, and the connective tissues that provide a suitable place for it to be situated and anchored. The main tissues that make up an organ tend to have common embryologic origins, such as arising from the same germ layer. Organs exist in most multicellular organisms. In single-celled organisms such as bacteria, the functional analogue of an organ is known as an organelle. In plants, there are three main organs.In the study of anatomy, viscera (singular viscus) refers to the internal organs of the abdominal, thoracic, and pelvic cavities. The abdominal organs may be classified as solid organs, or hollow organs. The solid organs are the liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands. The hollow organs of the abdomen are the stomach, intestines, gallbladder, bladder, and rectum.

There are two types of cullet: internal and external. Internal cullet is composed of defective products detected and rejected by a quality control process during the industrial process of glass manufacturing, transition phases of product changes (such as thickness and color changes) and production offcuts. External cullet is waste glass that has been collected or reprocessed with the purpose of recycling. External cullet (which can be pre- or post-consumer) is classified as waste. The word \"cullet\", when used in the context of end-of-waste, will always refer to external cullet.\nTo be recycled, glass waste needs to be purified and cleaned of contamination. Then, depending on the end use and local processing capabilities, it might also have to be separated into different sizes and colours. Many recyclers collect different colors of glass separately since glass retains its color after recycling. The most common colours used for consumer containers are clear (flint) glass, green glass, and brown (amber) glass. Glass is ideal for recycling since none of the material is degraded by normal use.\nMany collection points have separate bins for clear (flint), green and brown (amber). Glass re-processors intending to make new glass containers require separation by color, because glass tends to retain its color after recycling. If the recycled glass is not going to be made into more glass, or if the glass re-processor uses newer optical sorting equipment, separation by color at the collection point may not be required.

It is less commonly made from post-consumer cotton which is discarded textile waste from consumers such as second hand clothing. The recycling process includes assessing the quality of cotton fibers through systematics collection, manually sorting the materials, and undergoing a mechanical or chemical process to break down the textile fabric into reusable fibers. In the mechanical process, fabrics are torn into individual fibers through a machine, and in the chemical process, the fabrics's chemical properties are broken down through chemical reaction processes such as Lyocell process and dissolution in ionic liquids. The mechanical process is the primary way to recycle textiles because the chemical process is not commercially used.Recycled cotton is less durable than virgin cotton due to the shorter length of recycled cotton fibers which result from mechanical recycling. As a result, recycled cotton requires the addition of additional materials such as polyester to improve durability. Therefore, recycled cotton is often used in products that do not require high-quality cotton fibers such as casual clothing and home building materials.Harvesting raw cotton is a resource intensive process that uses a lot of water, energy, and chemicals. Cotton recycling mitigates wastage and can be a more sustainable alternative to disposal because products can be made out of existing textiles instead of raw materials, therefore, reducing the resources required to harvest raw cotton. However, there are costs associated with cotton recycling, such as the risk of problem shifting and the impact of transporting collected materials which could exceed its intended benefits.

Additionally, 12% was incinerated and the remaining 79% sent to landfill or to the environment including the ocean.Almost all plastic is not biodegradable and absent recyling, spreads across the environment where it can cause harm. For example, as of 2015 approximately 8 million tons of waste plastic enter the oceans annually, damaging the ecosystem and forming ocean garbage patches.Almost all recycling is mechanical: melting and reforming plastic into other items. This can cause polymer degradation at a molecular level, and requires that waste be sorted by colour and polymer type before processing, which is complicated and expensive. Errors can lead to material with inconsistent properties, rendering it unappealing to industry. In feedstock recycling, waste plastic is converted into its starting chemicals, which can then become fresh plastic. This involves higher energy and capital costs. Alternatively, plastic can be burned in place of fossil fuels. In some countries, it is the dominant form of plastic waste disposal, particularly where landfill diversion policies are in place.\nPlastic recycling is low in the waste hierarchy.

This includes the appropriate treatment, transport, and disposal of the collected waste. South Korea's Waste Management Law was established in 1986, replacing the Environmental Protection Law (1963) and the Filth and Cleaning Law (1973). This new law aimed to reduce general waste under the waste hierarchy (or three 'R's) in South Korea. This Waste Management Law imposed a volume-based waste fee system, effective for waste produced by both household and industrial activities (or municipal solid waste).\nThe Waste Management Law began the regulation of systematic waste streams through basic principles in waste management practices, from reduction to disposal of waste. This law also encouraged recycling and resource conservation through a deposit-refund system and a landfill post-closure management system.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Waste management: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management@@South Korea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea@@Waste: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Due to its limited space, semi-arid climate, high population growth and resource scarcity, Israel is highly susceptible to environmental crises. These include water shortages and pollution, shrinking of the Dead Sea, waste production and disposal, air pollution and population density. As a result, resource development, in particular water, has benefited from relatively high government support throughout most of the country's history. For example, Israel's water conservation and reclamation infrastructure is one of the most advanced in the world, with approximately half its water supply derived from reclaimed and treated waste water, brackish water and desalinated water.Additionally, Israel is party to several international agreements regarding air pollution and climate change, including the Kyoto Protocol, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Montreal Protocol. Despite having taken these steps, Israel's environment continues to suffer as a rapidly growing population and standard of living contributes to increasing Green House Gas emissions and air pollutants, reductions in natural and open spaces via urbanization, over-pumping of water sources beyond their replenishment rates and deterioration of water used for drinking and irrigation.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " State of Israel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel@@Dead Sea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea@@Kyoto Protocol: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol@@UN Framework Convention on Climate Change: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change@@Montreal Protocol: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. The goal of hyperspectral imaging is to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene, with the purpose of finding objects, identifying materials, or detecting processes. There are three general branches of spectral imagers. There are push broom scanners and the related whisk broom scanners (spatial scanning), which read images over time, band sequential scanners (spectral scanning), which acquire images of an area at different wavelengths, and snapshot hyperspectral imaging, which uses a staring array to generate an image in an instant.\nWhereas the human eye sees color of visible light in mostly three bands (long wavelengths - perceived as red, medium wavelengths - perceived as green, and short wavelengths - perceived as blue), spectral imaging divides the spectrum into many more bands. This technique of dividing images into bands can be extended beyond the visible. In hyperspectral imaging, the recorded spectra have fine wavelength resolution and cover a wide range of wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging measures continuous spectral bands, as opposed to multiband imaging which measures spaced spectral bands.Engineers build hyperspectral sensors and processing systems for applications in astronomy, agriculture, molecular biology, biomedical imaging, geosciences, physics, and surveillance. Hyperspectral sensors look at objects using a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Certain objects leave unique 'fingerprints' in the electromagnetic spectrum. Known as spectral signatures, these 'fingerprints' enable identification of the materials that make up a scanned object. For example, a spectral signature for oil helps geologists find new oil fields.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " \n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "World-systems theory (also known as world-systems analysis or the world-systems perspective) is a multidisciplinary approach to world history and social change which emphasizes the world-system (and not nation states) as the primary (but not exclusive) unit of social analysis.\"World-system\" refers to the inter-regional and transnational division of labor, which divides the world into core countries, semi-periphery countries, and the periphery countries. Core countries focus on higher-skill, capital-intensive production, and the rest of the world focuses on low-skill, labor-intensive production and extraction of raw materials. This constantly reinforces the dominance of the core countries. Nonetheless, the system has dynamic characteristics, in part as a result of revolutions in transport technology, and individual states can gain or lose their core (semi-periphery, periphery) status over time. This structure is unified by the division of labour. It is a world-economy rooted in a capitalist economy. For a time, certain countries become the world hegemon; during the last few centuries, as the world-system has extended geographically and intensified economically, this status has passed from the Netherlands, to the United Kingdom and (most recently) to the United States.Components of the world-systems analysis are longue dur\u00e9e by Fernand Braudel, \"development of underdevelopment\" by Gunder Frank, and the single-society assumption. Longue dur\u00e9e is the concept of the gradual change through the day-to-day activities by which social systems are continually reproduced. \"Development of underdevelopment\" described that the economic processes in the periphery are the opposite of the development in the core. Poorer countries are impoverished to enable a few countries to get richer. Lastly, the single-society assumption opposes the multiple-society assumption and includes looking at the world as a whole.World-systems theory has been examined by many political theorists and sociologists to explain the reasons for the rise and fall of states, income inequality, social unrest, and imperialism.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " World-system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World-system@@Core countries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_countries@@Netherlands: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands@@United Kingdom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom@@United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States@@Fernand Braudel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernand_Braudel@@Longue dur\u00e9e: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longue_dur%C3%A9e\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Japan emerged as one of the largest foreign aid donors in the world during the 1980s.\nIn 1991 Japan was the second largest foreign aid donor worldwide, behind the United States. Japan's ratio of foreign aid to GNP in this year was 0.32%, behind the 0.35% average for the OECD's Development Assistance Committee member countries, but ahead of the United States ratio of 0.20%.\nThe foreign aid program began in the 1960s out of the reparations payments Japan was obliged to pay to other Asian countries for war damage. The program's budget remained quite low until the late 1970s, when Japan came under increasing pressure from other industrial countries to play a larger role. During the 1980s, Japan's foreign aid budget grew quickly, despite the budget constraints imposed by the effort to reduce the fiscal deficit. From 1984 to 1991, the Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget increased at an average annual rate of 22.5%, reaching US$11.1 billion by 1991. Part of this rise was the result of exchange rate movements (with given yen amounts committed in the budget becoming larger dollar amounts). During the 1980s, foreign aid rose at a lower, but still strong, rate of between 4% and 12% annually in the government budget, with an average annual rate of growth from 1979 to 1988 of 8.6%.\nDuring the 1970s, the government took positive measures to increase its Official Development Assistance (ODA) to developing countries and to contribute to the stabilization of the international trade and monetary system. These measures were generally welcomed abroad, although some countries felt that the steps taken were not executed as rapidly or were not as extensive as similar efforts by some other advanced industrialized nations. Japan's ODA increased tenfold during the decade and stood at US$3.3 billion in 1980, but this ODA as a percentage of GNP was still below the average of other donor countries.\nIn the 1980s, Japan's ODA continued to rise rapidly. ODA net disbursements, in nominal terms, averaged around US$3 billion per year in the early 1980s and then jumped to US$5.6 billion in 1986 and US$9.1 billion in 1990. Japan's share of total disbursements from major aid donors also grew significantly, from nearly 11.8% in 1979 to about 15% in the mid-1980s, and later to more than 19% in 1989 dropping back to under 17% in 1990. Japan's ODA as a percentage of its GNP, however, did not increase substantially during the 1980s, remaining at about 0.3%.\nJapan continued to concentrate its economic assistance in Asia (about 60% of total commitments in 1990), reflecting its historical and economic ties to the region. Japan made modest increases in aid to Africa with the announcement in 1989 of a US$600 million grant program for the next three years. In 1990, Japan also pledged large amounts of assistance to Eastern Europe, but most of that aid was to be in the form of market rate credits and investment insurance, which did not qualify as ODA. In other regions, Japan appeared likely to continue allocating relatively small shares of assistance. Nevertheless, by 1987 Japan had become the largest bilateral donor in twenty-nine countries, nearly double the number in which that had been the case ten years earlier.\nThe continued growth of Japan's foreign aid appears to be motivated by two fundamental factors. First, Japanese policy is aimed at assuming international responsibilities commensurate with its position as a global economic power. Second, many believed, the growing Japanese foreign aid program comes largely in response to pressure from the United States and other allies for Japan to take on a greater share of the financial burdens in support of shared security, political, and economic interests.\nSuch assistance consisted of grants and loans and of support for multilateral aid organizations. In 1990 Japan allocated US$6.9 billion of its aid budget to bilateral assistance and US$2.3 billion to multilateral agencies. Of the bilateral assistance, US$3.0 billion went for grants and US$3.9 billion for concessional loans.\nJapan's foreign aid program has been criticized for better serving the interests of Japanese corporations than those of developing countries. In the past, tied aid (grants or loans tied to the purchase of merchandise from Japan) was high, but untied aid expanded rapidly in the 1980s, reaching 71% of all aid by 1986. This share compared favorably with other Development Assistance Committee countries and with the United States corresponding figure of 54%. Nevertheless, complaints continued that even Japan's untied aid tended to be directed toward purchases from Japan. Aid in the form of grants (the share of aid disbursed as grants rather than as loans) was low relative to other Development Assistance Committee countries and remained so late in the 1980s.\nBilateral assistance was concentrated in the developing countries of Asia, although modest moves took place in the 1980s to expand the geographical scope of aid. In 1990 some 59.3% of bilateral development assistance was allocated to Asia, 11.4% to Africa, 10.2% to the Middle East, and 8.1% to Latin America. Asia's share was down somewhat, from 75% in 1975 and 70% in 1980, but still accounted for by far the largest share of bilateral aid. During the 1980s, increased aid went to Pakistan and Egypt, partly in response to pressure from the United States to provide such aid for strategic purposes. Japan had little involvement in Africa, but the severe drought of the 1980s brought an increase in the share of development assistance for that continent.\nThe five largest recipients of Japanese ODA in 1990 were in Asia: Indonesia (US$1.1 billion), People's Republic of China (US$832 million), Thailand (US$448.8 million), the Philippines (US$403.8 million), and Bangladesh (US$370.6 million). Earlier in the 1980s, China had been the largest single recipient for several successive years. These large aid amounts made Japan the largest single source of development assistance for most Asian countries. For the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, for example, Japan supplied 55% of net ODA received in 1987, compared with 11% from the United States and only 10% from the multilateral aid agencies.\nThe rapid economic growth and rising competitiveness of China readjusted Sino-Japanese relations, and ODA and yen loans to China will gradually phase out until the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\nThe largest use of Japan's bilateral aid is for economic infrastructure (transportation, communications, river development, and energy development), which accounted for 31.5% of the total in 1990. Smaller shares went to development of the production sector (17.1%) and social infrastructure (19.7%). In general, large construction projects predominate in Japan's bilateral foreign aid. Within the category of social infrastructure, education absorbed 6.7% of the bilateral aid in 1990, water supply and sanitation made up 3.4%, and only 2% went for health. Food aid (0.4% of total bilateral aid in 1990) and debt relief (4.3%) also were included in Japan's official development assistance.\nIn January, 2022, it was announced that Japan planned to begin incorporating security assistance into foreign aid. Until now, Japan has only provided foreign aid for nonmilitary purposes. The change comes amid a broader policy shift that includes an increase in defense spending.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Japan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan@@United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States@@Asia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia@@Official Development Assistance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_development_assistance@@Africa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa@@Middle East: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East@@Latin America: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America@@Pakistan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan@@Egypt: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt@@Indonesia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia@@People's Republic of China: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China@@Thailand: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand@@Philippines: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines@@Bangladesh: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh@@ASEAN: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN@@Sino-Japanese relations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93Japan_relations@@2008 Summer Olympics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics@@Beijing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing\n\n^^^^^\n"}

It features a 1.250 mi (2.012 km) oval that hosts the NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, and the NTT IndyCar Series, a 2.000-mile (3.219 km) infield road course used by SpeedTour TransAm, SCCA, and Porsche Club of America, a quarter-mile NHRA-sanctioned drag strip that hosts the annual NHRA Camping World Drag Racing Series Midwest Nationals event, and the Kartplex, a state-of-the-art karting facility.\nThe first major event held at the facility was the CART Series on Saturday May 24, 1997, the day before the Indy Racing League's Indianapolis 500. Rather than scheduling a race directly opposite the Indy 500 (as they had done in 1996 with the U.S. 500), CART scheduled Gateway the day before to serve as their Memorial Day weekend open-wheel alternative without direct conflict. For 2000, the race was moved to the fall. In 2001, it was dropped from the CART series schedule, and switched alliances to the Indy Racing League. After mediocre attendance, the event was dropped altogether after 2003. It was later re-added to the schedule for 2017.\nIn 1998, the then named Gateway International Raceway was purchased by Dover Motorsports, a group that also owned what is now Memphis International Raceway, along with the Nashville Superspeedway and Dover International Speedway. On November 3, 2010, Dover Motorsports closed the facility. On September 8, 2011, the facility was re-opened by local St. Louis real estate developer and former Indy Lights driver Curtis Francois and renamed Gateway Motorsports Park, saving the facility days before being scrapped. Under its new leadership, World Wide Technology Raceway went from the brink of demolition to one of the very few tracks in the United States to host the NASCAR Cup Series, NTT IndyCar Series, and NHRA Camping World Drag Racing Series all during the same year.

{"prompt": "Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays. \nSpider-Man's secret identity is Peter Parker, a teenage high school student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and his enemies such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider-powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider; these include superhuman strength, speed, agility, jump, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination and balance, clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider, and detecting danger with his precognition ability called \"spider-sense.\" He also builds wrist-mounted \"web-shooter\" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design that were used for fighting his enemies and web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker originally used his powers for his own personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter didn't stop, Peter begins to use his spider-powers to fight crime by becoming the superhero known as Spider-Man.\nWhen Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Man's secret identity, whose \"self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness\" were issues to which young readers could relate. While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he had learn the lesson for himself that \"with great power comes great responsibility\" \u2014 a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man's origin story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, his late Uncle Ben Parker.\nMarvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York City high school student to a troubled but outgoing college student, to a married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers. Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012\u20132014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die. Marvel has also published comic books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in the alternate universe; and then Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager named Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later became a superhero in his own right and was brought into mainstream continuity, where he sometimes works alongside Peter.\nSpider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes. He has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated TV series including the first original animated series Spider-Man with Paul Soles voicing Spider-Man, a live-action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and multiple series of films. Spider-Man was first portrayed in live-action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a The Electric Company skit from 1974 to 1977. In live-action films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, by Andrew Garfield in two films directed by Marc Webb, and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. Reeve Carney starred originally as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. Spider-Man was also been voiced by Jake Johnson and Chris Pine in the animated film called Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.

{"prompt": "Metaflow Technologies was a La Jolla, California-based microprocessor design company. It was founded in 1988 by Val Popescu, Merle Schultz, Gary Gibson, John Spracklen, and Bruce Lightner.\nThe company is not well known to the general public as none of its designs were ever manufactured in volume. The company is known within the computer architecture community as it published articles in technical journals in the early 1990s that described how an out-of-order with speculative execution CPU might be designed. This was one of the first publicly disclosed OoO designs from a non-academic source.\nDescribed as specialising in VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) technology, this having been licensed to Intel, Metaflow announced a collaboration with LSI Logic and Hyundai to develop a CMOS-based SPARC processor codenamed Lightning capable of achieving a performance of 80 MIPS, being around double that of some contemporary SPARC designs. The product itself was a multi-chip processor designed according to the architectural principles previously published by the company. The chips were designed and built by LSI Logic, but that support went away before full production could be reached.\nThe Thunder project was a follow-on that was funded by Hyundai. Hyundai gained control of the company in 1994. This project did not go into production either.\nThe company was acquired by ST Microelectronics (called SGS Thomson Microelectronics at the time) in 1998. ST Micro originally wanted this design team to work on an Intel IA-32 clone, but eventually the team was used for non-personal computer SOCs.\nIt is rumored that Metaflow collaborated with the Intel team that would eventually design the Pentium Pro, the first commercially available Out-of-Order x86 processor.Following STMicroelectronics' acquisition in May 1997 of a majority stake in Metaflow, the relationship between the companies soured. Sources indicate that the two were unable to agree on which direction to take Metaflow's technology, creating a rift that resulted in ST's buying out Metaflow's last remaining founders: President Val Popescu, Vice President Bruce Lightner, and Director of Engineering Gary Gibson. Gibson has since taken a position with Mosart Systems, working on some as-yet-undisclosed new processor.\nThe originator of much of the technology underlying today's superscalar out-of-order microprocessors, Metaflow was never able to reap its just rewards. Begun in 1985, the company's first project, a SPARC-based ECL gate-array processor, was supplanted in 1989 by Lightning, a CMOS design backed by funding and IC-design resources from Hyundai. But the division of labor between the two companies proved stormy, and in 1991 Lightning was discharged, creating Thunder\u2014a 0.8-micrometre three-chip processor designed entirely by Metaflow. In 1995, the company successfully demonstrated an 80-MHz Thunder processor\u2014which delivered 2.5 SPECint92/MHz\u2014just as Hyundai decided it wanted x86-based processors instead of SPARCs.\nMetaflow had a brush with success in the early 1990s when, working under contract to Intel, it convinced the processor giant that out-of-order design offered the best hope for building fast x86 processors. In fact, sources indicate that inside Intel the P6 was initially referred to as the \"Metaflow processor.\" Sources have also revealed that Intel actually tried to buy Metaflow, but Andy Grove, unable to come to terms with Hyundai, had to abort the purchase.Intel subsequently acquired the IP rights to Metaflow's technology through a patent cross-license with Hyundai for DRAM technology. The Pentium Pro using a centralized reservation station and instant repair of out-of-order and speculative execution, bears the clear mark of Metaflow\u00b9s involvement. More than 150 Intel patents cite Metaflow intellectual property as prior art. In 1997, frustrated by the inability to control its own IP and thus its own destiny, Metaflow convinced Hyundai to sell out to ST. Since then, ST and Metaflow have been jointly developing an x86-based processor. But, already unhappy with ST's plans for that part as well as with its lackluster process technology, Metaflow's leaders were pushed over the brink when ST traded Metaflow's IP to IBM in an x86-for-PowerPC swap.Some Metaflow designers continue to work on ST's x86 project, but with the leaders gone and ST more interested in the low end of the x86 market, chances are slim that the x86 chip will ever see daylight\u2014especially now that ST has a Pentium-class x86 project under way in India. ST officials declined to comment, other than to acknowledge that ST has indeed taken full ownership of Metaflow and to express confidence in the design team that remains.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " La Jolla, California: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jolla@@VLIW: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_long_instruction_word@@Intel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel@@LSI Logic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSI_Corporation@@SPARC: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC@@ST Microelectronics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STMicroelectronics@@IA-32: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA-32@@Pentium Pro: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_Pro\n\n^^^^^\n"}

They were also resisting the expansion into this area of the cotton economy, led by large-scale planters who hired many African Americans as sharecroppers. \nAfter two prominent white attorneys related to the land company were kidnapped and one murdered in Lake County, Tennessee governor Malcolm Rice Patterson directed an investigation and ordered in the state militia to suppress the violence.

{"prompt": "The Springfield race riot of 1908 consisted of events of mass racial violence committed against African Americans by a mob of about 5,000 white Americans and European immigrants in Springfield, Illinois, between August 14 and 16, 1908. Two black men had been arrested as suspects in a rape, and attempted rape and murder. The alleged victims were two young white women and the father of one of them. When a mob seeking to lynch the men discovered the sheriff had transferred them out of the city, the whites furiously spread out to attack black neighborhoods, murdered black citizens on the streets, and destroyed black businesses and homes.  The state militia was called out to quell the rioting.\nThe riot, trials and aftermath are said to be one of the most well-documented examples of the complex intersection of race, class, and criminal justice in the United States.  In 2008 an NPR report on the centenary of the race riot said that the fact of its taking place in a Northern state, specifically in \"The Land of Lincoln\", demonstrated that black people were mistreated across the country, not just in the South, and described the event as a proxy for the story of race in America.At least sixteen people died as a result of the riot: nine black residents, and seven white residents who were associated with the mob, five of whom were killed by black residents and two committed suicide. It was misreported for decades that only militia were responsible for white deaths and that more whites than black people had died. Personal and property damages, suffered overwhelmingly by black people, amounted to more than $150,000 (approximately $4 million in 2018), as dozens of black homes and businesses were destroyed, as well as three white-owned businesses of suspected black sympathizers.As a result of the rioting, numerous black people left Springfield, but it is unclear how many moved away permanently. Although in the following months over 100 riot-related indictments were issued and some pled to minor violations, only one alleged rioter went to trial and conviction for lesser offenses. Of the two accused black men, who were the initial focus of the lynch mob, one was eventually tried, convicted and hanged, the other was set free. Near the 100th anniversary in 2008, the City of Springfield erected historical markers and a memorial statue.

{"prompt": "The Jim Crow laws were state and local laws introduced in the Southern United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that enforced  racial segregation, \"Jim Crow\" being a pejorative term for an African-American. Such laws remained in force until the 1960s. Formal and informal segregation policies were present in other areas of the United States as well, even if several states outside the South had banned discrimination in public accommodations and voting. Southern laws were enacted by white Southern Democrat-dominated state legislatures to disenfranchise and remove political and economic gains made by African Americans during the Reconstruction era.In practice, Jim Crow laws mandated racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America and in some others, beginning in the 1870s. Jim Crow laws were upheld in 1896 in the case of Plessy vs. Ferguson, in which the Supreme Court laid out its \"separate but equal\" legal doctrine concerning facilities for African Americans. Moreover, public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War in 1861\u20131865.\nAlthough in theory, the \"equal\" segregation doctrine was extended to public facilities and transportation too, facilities for African Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to facilities for white Americans; sometimes, there were no facilities for the black community at all. Far from equality, as a body of law, Jim Crow institutionalized economic, educational, political and social disadvantages and second class citizenship for most African Americans living in the United States.  After the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was founded in 1909, it became involved in a sustained public protest and campaigns against the Jim Crow laws, and the so-called \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\nIn 1954, segregation of public schools (state-sponsored) was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education. In some states, it took many years to implement this decision, while the Warren Court continued to rule against Jim Crow legislation in other cases such as Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964). In general, the remaining Jim Crow laws were overturned by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Jim Crow: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws@@Southern United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States@@African-American: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans@@Southern Democrat: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Democrats@@African Americans: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans@@Reconstruction era: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era@@Confederate States of America: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America@@Plessy vs. Ferguson: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson@@National Association for the Advancement of Colored People: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP@@NAACP: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP@@U.S. Supreme Court: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States@@Brown v.

Although the chronological limits of this period are open to debate, the timeframe is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Renaissance period in Europe and Timurid Central Asia, the Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent, the end of the Crusades, the Age of Discovery (especially the voyages of Christopher Columbus beginning in 1492 but also Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea route to India in 1498), and ending around the French Revolution in 1789, or Napoleon's rise to power.Historians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its spreading globalizing character. New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the period. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of mercantilism as an economic theory.

{"prompt": "French literature (French: litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise) generally speaking, is literature written in the French language, particularly by citizens of France; it may also refer to literature written by people living in France who speak traditional languages of France other than French. Literature written in the French language by citizens of other nations such as Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, Senegal, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, etc. is referred to as Francophone literature. \nFor centuries, French literature has been an object of national pride for French people, and it has been one of the most influential components of the literature of Europe. France ranks first on the list of Nobel Prizes in literature by country.\nOne of the first known examples of French literature is the Song of Roland, the first major work in a series of poems known as, \"chansons de geste\".The French language is a Romance language derived from Latin and heavily influenced principally by Celtic and Frankish. Beginning in the 11th century, literature written in medieval French was one of the oldest vernacular (non-Latin) literatures in western Europe and it became a key source of literary themes in the Middle Ages across the continent.\nAlthough the European prominence of French literature was eclipsed in part by vernacular literature in Italy in the 14th century, literature in France in the 16th century underwent a major creative evolution, and through the political and artistic programs of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, French literature came to dominate European letters in the 17th century.\nIn the 18th century, French became the literary lingua franca and diplomatic language of western Europe (and, to a certain degree, in America), and French letters have had a profound impact on all European and American literary traditions while at the same time being heavily influenced by these other national traditions. Africa and the far East have brought the French language to non-European cultures that are transforming and adding to the French literary experience today.\nUnder the aristocratic ideals of the Ancien R\u00e9gime (the \"honn\u00eate homme\"), the nationalist spirit of post-revolutionary France, and the mass educational ideals of the Third Republic and modern France, the French have come to have a profound cultural attachment to their literary heritage. Today, French schools emphasize the study of novels, theater and poetry (often learnt by heart). The literary arts are heavily sponsored by the state and literary prizes are major news. The Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise and the Institut de France are important linguistic and artistic institutions in France, and French television features shows on writers and poets (one of the most watched shows on French television was Apostrophes, a weekly talk show on literature and the arts). Literature matters deeply to the people of France and plays an important role in their sense of identity.\nAs of 2022, fifteen French authors have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature which is more than novelists, poets and essayists of any other country. In 1964 Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, but he declined it, stating that \"It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize winner. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.\"\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " French language: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language@@France: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France@@Senegal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal@@Tunisia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia@@Algeria: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria@@Morocco: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco@@Francophone literature: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francophone_literature@@French people: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people@@Latin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin@@Middle Ages: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages@@Ancien R\u00e9gime: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancien_R%C3%A9gime@@Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Fran%C3%A7aise@@Institut de France: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_de_France@@Nobel Prize in Literature: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature@@Jean-Paul Sartre: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre@@Nobel Prize: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Over the past two decades, the main thrust of Grenada's economy has shifted from agriculture to services, with tourism serving as the leading foreign currency earning sector. The country's principal export crops are the spices nutmeg and mace (Grenada is the world's second largest producer of nutmeg after Indonesia). Other crops for export include cocoa, citrus fruits, bananas, cloves, and cinnamon. Manufacturing industries in Grenada operate mostly on a small scale, including production of beverages and other foodstuffs, textiles, and the assembly of electronic components for export.\nEconomic growth picked up in the late 1990s following slow growth and domestic fiscal adjustment in early years of the decade. Despite an expansionary fiscal policy, the public debt remained moderate at around 50 percent of GDP as deficits were financed partly by privatization receipts. Since 2001, economic growth declined. The decline was caused by adverse shocks, such as a slowdown in the global economy and natural disasters. To deal with the shocks, fiscal policy became more expansionary, while privatization receipts declined. As a result, public debt increased sharply to near 110 percent of GDP in 2003. Economic conditions worsened when Hurricane Ivan hit the country in September 2004; progress in fiscal consolidation was impeded as government revenues fell and policy priority was shifted to post-hurricane relief.\nAlthough reconstruction has proceeded quickly with significant aid from the international community, tourism and agricultural activities remain weak and nearly offset the stimulus from the reconstruction boom. The country is still facing the difficult task of reconstruction and recovery, while public debt is unsustainable and the government faces large financing gaps. In the years ahead, reinvigorating growth will be a high priority, and continued efforts are needed to address vulnerabilities.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Grenada: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada@@GDP: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product@@Hurricane Ivan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Ivan\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Although their commanders said the soldiers had been in the barracks all night, evidence was allegedly planted against the men.As a result of a United States Army Inspector General's investigation, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered the discharge without honor of 167 soldiers of the 25th Infantry Regiment, costing them pensions and preventing them from ever serving in federal civil service jobs. The case aroused national outrage in both black and white communities. After more investigation, several of the men were allowed to re-enlist.\nFollowing publication of a history of the affair in the early 1970s, a renewed military investigation exonerated the discharged black troops.

{"prompt": "The Day Law mandated racial segregation in educational institutions in Kentucky. Formally designated \"An Act to Prohibit White and Colored Persons from Attending the Same School,\" the bill was introduced in the Kentucky House of Representatives by Carl Day in January 1904, and signed into law by Governor J.C.W. Beckham in March 1904. As well as prohibiting students of color from attending the same school as white students, the law prohibited individual schools from operating separate black and white branches within 25 miles of each other.\nBerea College at the time was the only integrated college in Kentucky. As the bill was being debated in the Kentucky House of Representatives Committee on Education, two groups came to Frankfort to lobby the legislators. One group was led by Berea College President William G. Frost and his wife to protest the bill while the other group was led by Berea's Democrat Club president, J.M. Early, to speak in support of the bill. State Superintendent of Education Harry McChesney also spoke in favor of the bill.Berea College was criminally convicted and fined $1,000. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky denied Berea College's appeal, agreeing with the Kentucky General Assembly on the law's purpose, that of preventing racial violence and interracial marriage.In 1908, the US Supreme Court affirmed the legitimacy of Commonwealth's right to prohibit individuals and corporations from operating integrated schools. The decision in Berea College v. Kentucky extended the 1896 opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson to include colleges and universities specifically on the grounds that they were charted by the state. The Kentucky Justice John Marshall Harlan dissented, as he had done with Plessy v. Ferguson, as he thought that it was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and was a governmental intrusion on citizens' private lives. The Supreme Court, fifty years later, took a position similar to Justice Harlan in its ruling on Brown v. Board of Education, Topeka.\nThe trustees of Berea College worked to build a new college that would serve the needs of Kentucky's black students seeking higher education. With a challenge grant of $200,000 from Andrew Carnegie, the trustees raised the matching funds and purchased 444.4 ac of farmland in Shelby County. By the fall of 1912, the Lincoln Institute opened its doors to its first students. By the 1930s, however, the junior college courses were no longer offered. The historically black college in Frankfort, which eventually would become Kentucky State University, had taken on a stronger role in black higher education. Lincoln Institute's students could take only vocational and college preparatory courses until it closed in 1966.\nThe Kentucky Department of Education created in 1924 a Division of Negro Education.The Day Law became illegal upon the Supreme Court's decision in 1954 in the landmark case, Brown v.

Chronicling the American Civil War and Reconstruction era from a pro-Confederate perspective, it presents the Ku Klux Klan heroically. The novel was adapted as a play and a film, first by the author as a highly successful play entitled The Clansman (1905), and a decade later by D. W. Griffith in the 1915 movie The Birth of a Nation.Dixon wrote The Clansman in support of racial segregation, as it showed free blacks turning savage and violent, committing crimes such as murder, rape, and robbery far out of proportion to their percentage of the population. He claimed that 18,000,000 Southerners supported his beliefs. Dixon portrays the Radical Republican speaker of the house, Austin Stoneman (based on Thaddeus Stevens, from Pennsylvania), as a rapacious, vindictive, race traitor, mad with power and eaten up with hate. His goal is to punish the Southern whites for their revolution against an \"oppressive\" government (the Union) by turning the former slaves against the white Southerners and using the iron fist of the Union occupation troops to make them the new masters. In Dixon's characterization, the Klan's job is to protect white Southerners from the carpetbaggers and their allies, black and white.\nThe book and its stage and film adaptations were highly controversial in their time, and continue to receive criticism for their espousal of racist and Neo-Confederate sentiments.

The speech was preceded by the reading of a dedicatory ode written by Frank Lebby Stanton.Washington began with a call to the blacks, who composed one third of the Southern population, to join the world of work. He declared that the South was where  blacks were given their chance, as opposed to the North, especially in the worlds of commerce and industry.  He told the white audience that rather than relying on the immigrant population arriving at the rate of a million people a year, they should hire some of the nation's eight million blacks. He praised blacks'  loyalty, fidelity and love in service to the white population, but warned that they could be a great burden on society if oppression continued, stating that the progress of the South was inherently tied to the treatment of blacks and protection of their liberties.\nHe addressed the inequality between commercial legality and social acceptance, proclaiming that \"The opportunity to earn a dollar in a factory just now is worth infinitely more than the opportunity to spend a dollar in an opera house.\" Washington also promoted segregation by claiming that blacks and whites could exist as separate fingers of a hand.\nThe title \"Atlanta Compromise Speech\" was given to the speech by W.

Due to these large numbers, it has been given the nickname \"a gated community\". Located in West Feliciana Parish, the prison is set between oxbow lakes on the east side of a bend of the Mississippi River, thus flanked on three sides by water. It lies less than two miles (three kilometers) south of Louisiana's straight east-west border with Mississippi.\nThe 28 square miles (18,000 acres) of land the prison sits on what was known before the American Civil War as the Angola Plantations, a slave plantation, owned by slave trader Isaac Franklin. The prison is located at the end of Louisiana Highway 66, around 22 miles (35 km) northwest of St. Francisville. Death row for men and the state execution chamber for women and men are located at the Angola facility.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Louisiana: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana@@Angola: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola@@Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Department_of_Public_Safety_%26_Corrections@@West Feliciana Parish: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Feliciana_Parish,_Louisiana@@American Civil War: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War@@Isaac Franklin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Franklin@@Louisiana Highway 66: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Highway_66@@Death row: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_row\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "The Lodge Bill of 1890, also referred to as the Federal Elections Bill or by critics as the Lodge Force Bill, was a proposed bill to ensure the security of elections for U.S. Representatives.\nIt was drafted and proposed by Representative Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts and sponsored in the Senate by George Frisbie Hoar with the endorsement of President Benjamin Harrison and all Republicans. The bill provided for the federal regulation of elections to the United States House of Representatives, where had heretofore been regulated by state governments. In particular, the bill would have permitted federal circuit courts (upon a petition by 500 citizens from any district) to appoint federal supervisors for congressional elections. Supervisors would have the power to attend elections, inspect registration lists, verify doubtful voter information, administer oaths to challenged voters, stop illegal aliens from voting, and certify the vote count. Perhaps most controversially, the supervisor would have the power to request Deputy United States Marshals to secure elections by force if deemed necessary.\nThe bill was created primarily to enforce the ability of blacks, predominantly Republican at the time, to vote in the Southern United States, as provided for in the constitution. The Fifteenth Amendment already formally guaranteed that right, but white southern Democrats had passed laws related to voter registration and electoral requirements, such as requiring payment of poll taxes and literacy tests (often waived if the prospective voter's grandfather had been a registered voter, the \"grandfather clause\"), that effectively prevented blacks from voting.  That year Mississippi passed a new constitution that disfranchised most blacks, and other states would soon follow the \"Mississippi plan\".\nAfter passing the House by just six votes, the Lodge bill was successfully filibustered in the Senate, with little action by the President of the Senate, Vice President Levi P. Morton, because Silver Republicans in the West traded it away for Southern support of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act and Northern Republicans traded it away for Southern support of the McKinley Tariff.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Henry Cabot Lodge: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge@@George Frisbie Hoar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frisbie_Hoar@@Benjamin Harrison: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison@@United States House of Representatives: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives@@United States Marshals: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service@@Southern United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States@@President of the Senate: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate@@Levi P.

{"prompt": "Louisville, New Orleans & Texas Railway Co. v. Mississippi, 133 U.S. 587 (1890), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States upheld a Mississippi law that required railroads to racially segregate their passengers. The Court in Hall v. Decuir (1878) had struck down a similar Louisiana law on the grounds that it unreasonably interfered with Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. A railroad challenged the Mississippi law on the same ground, arguing that it violated the Dormant Commerce Clause by burdening interstate commerce. The Supreme Court, dividing 7 to 2, disagreed. Writing for the majority, Justice David Josiah Brewer distinguished Hall on the basis that Mississippi's law, unlike Louisiana's, applied solely to intrastate commerce. Justices John Marshall Harlan and Joseph P. Bradley dissented. According to Harlan, the Mississippi law subjected all trains, including those involved in interstate commerce, to the segregation requirement. Finding no differences between the case and Hall, he voted to strike down the law.The justices did not expressly rule on whether segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause: that issue was not raised until Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). But scholar John Semoche argues that Louisville Railway \"was more pivotal that the more widely known\" Plessy case, since the argument that it rejected was even more narrow than the one presented in Plessy. The decision has been heavily criticized by the scholarly academy: Benno Schmidt, for instance, wrote that \"the Court revealed a greater commitment to the flourishing of segregation that to the flourishing of commerce\". In the 1946 case of Morgan v. Virginia, the Supreme Court overruled Louisville Railway, returning to the rule set forth in Hall.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Mississippi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi@@1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1@@1890: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890@@Supreme Court of the United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States@@Hall v.

{"prompt": "The sit-in movement, sit-in campaign or student sit-in movement, were a wave of sit-ins that followed the Greensboro sit-ins on February 1, 1960 in North Carolina.  The sit-in movement employed the tactic of nonviolent direct action and was a pivotal event during the Civil Rights Movement.African-American college students attending historically Black colleges and universities in the United States powered the sit-in movement across the country. Many students across the country followed by example, as sit-ins provided a powerful tool for students to use to attract attention. The students of Baltimore made use of this in 1960 where many used the efforts to desegregate department store restaurants, which proved to be successful lasting about three weeks. This was one small role Baltimore played in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The city facilitated social movements across the country as it saw bus and taxi companies hiring African-Americans in 1951\u20131952. Sit-ins also frequented segregated facilities in Oklahoma City between 1958 and 1964.Students at Baltimore, Maryland's, Morgan State College had successfully deployed sit-ins and other direct action protest tactics against lunch counters in that city since at least 1953. The local chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality had had similar success. Witnessing the unprecedented visibility afforded in the white-oriented mainstream media to the 1960 sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina, Morgan students (and others, including those from the Johns Hopkins University) continued sit-in campaigns already underway at department store restaurants near their campus. There were massive amounts of support from the community for the students\u2019 efforts, but more importantly, white involvement and support grew in favor of desegregation of department store restaurants.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Greensboro sit-ins: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_sit-ins@@North Carolina: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina@@Civil Rights Movement: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement@@United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States@@Baltimore, Maryland: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore@@Congress of Racial Equality: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality@@Johns Hopkins University: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "James Arthur Baldwin (August 2, 1924 \u2013 December 1, 1987) was an American writer. He garnered acclaim for his work across several mediums, including essays, novels, plays, and poems. His first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain, was published in 1953; decades later, Time magazine included the novel on its list of the 100 best English-language novels released from 1923 to 2005. His first essay collection, Notes of a Native Son, was published in 1955.Baldwin's work fictionalizes fundamental personal questions and dilemmas amid complex social and psychological pressures. Themes of masculinity, sexuality, race, and class intertwine to create intricate narratives that run parallel with some of the major political movements toward social change in mid-twentieth century America, such as the civil rights movement and the gay liberation movement. Baldwin's protagonists are often but not exclusively African American, and gay and bisexual men frequently feature prominently in his literature. These characters often face internal and external obstacles in their search for social and self-acceptance. Such dynamics are prominent in Baldwin's second novel, Giovanni's Room, which was written in 1956, well before the gay liberation movement.His reputation has endured since his death and his work has been adapted for the screen to great acclaim. An unfinished manuscript, Remember This House, was expanded and adapted for cinema as the documentary film I Am Not Your Negro (2016), which was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 89th Academy Awards. One of his novels, If Beale Street Could Talk, was adapted into the Academy Award\u2013 winning film of the same name in 2018, directed and produced by Barry Jenkins.In addition to writing, Baldwin was also a well-known, and controversial, public figure and orator, especially during the civil rights movement in the United States.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Time magazine: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)@@Notes of a Native Son: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_of_a_Native_Son@@Giovanni's Room: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni%27s_Room@@Remember This House: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remember_This_House@@I Am Not Your Negro: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Not_Your_Negro@@89th Academy Awards: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/89th_Academy_Awards@@If Beale Street Could Talk: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Beale_Street_Could_Talk@@Barry Jenkins: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Jenkins\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "The Selma to Montgomery marches were three protest marches, held in 1965, along the 54-mile (87 km) highway from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital of Montgomery. The marches were organized by nonviolent activists to demonstrate the desire of African-American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote, in defiance of segregationist repression; they were part of a broader voting rights movement underway in Selma and throughout the American South. By highlighting racial injustice, they contributed to passage that year of the Voting Rights Act, a landmark federal achievement of the civil rights movement.\nSouthern state legislatures had passed and maintained a series of discriminatory requirements and practices that had disenfranchised most of the millions of African Americans across the South for much of the previous century. The African-American group known as the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL) launched a voter registration campaign in Selma in 1963. Joined by organizers from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), they began working that year in a renewed effort to register black voters.\nFinding resistance by white officials to be intractable, even after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended legal segregation, the DCVL invited Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the activists of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to join them. SCLC brought many prominent civil rights and civic leaders to Selma in January 1965. Local and regional protests began, with 3,000 people arrested by the end of February.  According to Joseph A. Califano Jr., who served as head of domestic affairs for U.S. President Lyndon Johnson between the years 1965 and 1969, the president viewed King as an essential partner in getting the Voting Rights Act enacted. Califano, whom the president also assigned to monitor the final march to Montgomery, said that Johnson and King talked by telephone on January 15 to plan a strategy for drawing attention to the injustice of using literacy tests and other barriers to stop black Southerners from voting, and that King later informed the president on February 9 of his decision to use Selma to achieve this objective.On February 26, 1965, activist and deacon Jimmie Lee Jackson died after being shot several days earlier by state trooper James Bonard Fowler, during a peaceful march in nearby Marion, Alabama. To defuse and refocus the community's outrage, James Bevel, who was directing SCLC's Selma voting rights movement, called for a march of dramatic length, from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery. Bevel had been working on his Alabama Project for voting rights since late 1963.\nThe first march took place on March 7, 1965, organized locally by Bevel, Amelia Boynton, and others. State troopers and county possemen attacked the unarmed marchers with billy clubs and tear gas after they passed over the county line, and the event became known as Bloody Sunday. Law enforcement beat Boynton unconscious, and the media publicized worldwide a picture of her lying wounded on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.The second march took place on March 9. Troopers, police, and marchers confronted each other at the county end of the bridge, but when the troopers stepped aside to let them pass, King led the marchers back to the church. He was obeying a federal injunction while seeking protection from federal court for the march. That night, a white group beat and murdered civil rights activist James Reeb, a Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston, who had come to Selma to march with the second group. Many other clergy and sympathizers from across the country also gathered for the second march.\nThe violence of \"Bloody Sunday\" and Reeb's murder resulted in a national outcry and some acts of civil disobedience, targeting both the Alabama and federal governments.  The protesters demanded protection for the Selma marchers and a new federal voting rights law to enable African Americans to register and vote without harassment. President Johnson, whose administration had been working on a voting rights law, held a historic, nationally televised joint session of Congress on March 15 to ask for the bill's introduction and passage.\nWith Governor of Alabama George Wallace refusing to protect the marchers, President Johnson committed to do so. The third march started on March 21. Protected by 1,900 members of the Alabama National Guard under federal command, and many FBI agents and federal marshals, the marchers averaged 10 miles (16 km) a day along U.S. Route 80, known in Alabama as the \"Jefferson Davis Highway\". The marchers arrived in Montgomery on March 24 and at the Alabama State Capitol on March 25. With thousands having joined the campaign, 25,000 people entered the capital city that day in support of voting rights.\nThe route is memorialized as the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, a designated National Historic Trail.

{"prompt": "The Birmingham campaign, also known as the Birmingham movement or Birmingham confrontation, was an American movement organized in early 1963 by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to bring attention to the integration efforts of African Americans in Birmingham, Alabama.\nLed by Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, Fred Shuttlesworth and others, the campaign of nonviolent direct action culminated in widely publicized confrontations between young black students and white civic authorities, and eventually led the municipal government to change the city's discrimination laws.\nIn the early 1960s, Birmingham was one of the most racially divided cities in the United States, enforced both legally and culturally. Black citizens faced legal and economic disparities, and violent retribution when they attempted to draw attention to their problems. Martin Luther King Jr. called it the most segregated city in the country. Protests in Birmingham began with a boycott led by Shuttlesworth meant to pressure business leaders to open employment to people of all races, and end segregation in public facilities, restaurants, schools, and stores. When local business and governmental leaders resisted the boycott, the SCLC agreed to assist. Organizer Wyatt Tee Walker joined Birmingham activist Shuttlesworth and began what they called Project C, a series of sit-ins and marches intended to provoke mass arrests.When the campaign ran low on adult volunteers, James Bevel thought of the idea of having students become the main demonstrators in the Birmingham campaign. He then trained and directed high school, college, and elementary school students in nonviolence, and asked them to participate in the demonstrations by taking a peaceful walk 50 at a time from the 16th Street Baptist Church to City Hall in order to talk to the mayor about segregation. This resulted in over a thousand arrests, and, as the jails and holding areas filled with arrested students, the Birmingham Police Department, at the direction of the city Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, used high-pressure water hoses and police attack dogs on the children and adult bystanders. Not all of the bystanders were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of SCLC to hold a completely nonviolent walk, but the students held to the nonviolent premise. Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC drew both criticism and praise for allowing children to participate and put themselves in harm's way.\nThe Birmingham campaign was a model of nonviolent direct action protest and, through the media, drew the world's attention to racial segregation in the South. It burnished King's reputation, ousted Connor from his job, forced desegregation in Birmingham, and directly paved the way for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibited racial discrimination in hiring practices and public services throughout the United States.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Southern Christian Leadership Conference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Christian_Leadership_Conference@@African Americans: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans@@Birmingham, Alabama: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama@@James Bevel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bevel@@Fred Shuttlesworth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Shuttlesworth@@United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States@@Wyatt Tee Walker: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Tee_Walker@@16th Street Baptist Church: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church@@Eugene \"Bull\" Connor: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Connor@@Civil Rights Act of 1964: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "Freedom Riders were civil rights activists who rode interstate buses into the segregated Southern United States in 1961 and subsequent years to challenge the non-enforcement of the United States Supreme Court decisions Morgan v. Virginia (1946) and Boynton v. Virginia (1960), which ruled that segregated public buses were unconstitutional. The Southern states had ignored the rulings and the federal government did nothing to enforce them. The first Freedom Ride left Washington, D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17.Boynton outlawed racial segregation in the restaurants and waiting rooms in terminals serving buses that crossed state lines. Five years prior to the Boynton ruling, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) had issued a ruling in Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company (1955) that had explicitly denounced the Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) doctrine of separate but equal in interstate bus travel. The ICC failed to enforce its ruling, and Jim Crow travel laws remained in force throughout the South.The Freedom Riders challenged this status quo by riding interstate buses in the South in mixed racial groups to challenge local laws or customs that enforced segregation in seating. The Freedom Rides, and the violent reactions they provoked, bolstered the credibility of the American Civil Rights Movement. They called national attention to the disregard for the federal law and the local violence used to enforce segregation in the southern United States. Police arrested riders for trespassing, unlawful assembly, violating state and local Jim Crow laws, and other alleged offenses, but often they first let white mobs attack them without intervention.\nThe Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) sponsored most of the subsequent Freedom Rides, but some were also organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). The Freedom Rides, beginning in 1960, followed dramatic sit-ins against segregated lunch counters conducted by students and youth throughout the South, and boycotts of retail establishments that maintained segregated facilities.\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Boynton supported the right of interstate travelers to disregard local segregation ordinances. Southern local and state police considered the actions of the Freedom Riders to be criminal and arrested them in some locations. In some localities, such as Birmingham, Alabama, the police cooperated with Ku Klux Klan chapters and other white people opposing the actions, and allowed mobs to attack the riders.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Southern United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States@@United States Supreme Court: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States@@Morgan v.

{"prompt": "African Americans have played an essential role in the history of Arkansas, but their role has often been marginalized as they confronted a society and polity controlled by white supremacists. During the slavery era to 1865, they were considered property and were subjected to the harsh conditions of forced labor. After the Civil War and the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Reconstuction Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, African Americans gained their freedom and the right to vote. However, the rise of Jim Crow laws in the 1890s and early 1900s led to a period of segregation and discrimination that lasted into the 1960s. Most were farmers, working their own property or poor sharecroppers on white-owned land, or very poor day laborers. By World War I, there was steady emigration from farms to nearby cities such as Little Rock and Memphis, as well as to St. Louis and Chicago.\nDuring the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, the African Americans fought for an end to segregation and discrimination. The Little Rock Nine, a group of Black students who enrolled in the previously all-white Little Rock Central High School in 1957, became a national symbol of the struggle for civil rights.\nIn the decades since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, progress has been made in the state, including the election of Black politicians to local and state offices, and the desegregation of schools and public spaces. However, disparities in areas such as education, healthcare, and economic opportunity still persist.\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Black women in Arkansas have  been continued to be active in the struggle for civil rights. Women such as Daisy Bates, who played a significant role in the integration of Little Rock Central High School, and Lottie Shackelford, the first Black woman elected to the Little Rock City Board of Directors, helped to bring about significant change in the state.  Today, Black women in Arkansas continue to face challenges related to systemic racism and discrimination. However, they continue to be leaders in their communities, working to effect change and improve the lives of those around them.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " African Americans: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans@@Arkansas: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas@@Jim Crow laws: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws@@Little Rock Nine: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_Nine@@Little Rock Central High School: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_Central_High_School\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "The Yamasee War (also spelled Yamassee or Yemassee) was a conflict fought in South Carolina from 1715 to 1717 between British settlers from the Province of Carolina and the Yamasee, who were supported by a number of allied Native American peoples, including the Muscogee, Cherokee, Catawba, Apalachee, Apalachicola, Yuchi, Savannah River Shawnee, Congaree, Waxhaw, Pee Dee, Cape Fear, Cheraw, and others. Some of the Native American groups played a minor role, while others launched attacks throughout South Carolina in an attempt to destroy the colony.\nNative Americans killed hundreds of colonists and destroyed many settlements, and they killed traders throughout the southeastern region. Colonists abandoned the frontiers and fled to Charles Town, where starvation set in as supplies ran low. The survival of the South Carolina colony was in question during 1715. The tide turned in early 1716 when the Cherokee sided with the colonists against the Creek, their traditional enemy. The last Native American fighters withdrew from the conflict in 1717, bringing a fragile peace to the colony.\nThe Yamasee War was one of the most disruptive and transformational conflicts of colonial America. For more than a year, the colony faced the possibility of annihilation. About 70 percent of South Carolina's settlers were killed, making the war one of the bloodiest wars in American history. The Yamasee War and its aftermath shifted the geopolitical situation of both the European colonies and native groups, and contributed to the emergence of new Native American confederations, such as the Muscogee Creek and Catawba.\nThe origin of the war was complex, and reasons for fighting differed among the many Indian groups that participated. Factors included the trading system, trader abuses, the Indian slave trade, the depletion of deer, increasing Indian debts in contrast to increasing wealth among some colonists, the spread of rice plantation agriculture, French power in Louisiana offering an alternative to British trade, long-established Indian links to Spanish Florida, power struggles among Indian groups, and recent experiences in military collaboration among previously distant tribes.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Yamasee: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamasee@@South Carolina: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina@@Province of Carolina: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Carolina@@Cherokee: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee@@Apalachee: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apalachee@@Yuchi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuchi@@Savannah River: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_River@@Shawnee: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee@@Muscogee Creek: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscogee@@Indian slave trade: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_among_Native_Americans_in_the_United_States@@Spanish Florida: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Florida\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Wi-Fi () is a family of wireless network protocols based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards, which are commonly used for local area networking of devices and Internet access, allowing nearby digital devices to exchange data by radio waves.  These are the most widely used computer networks in the world, used globally in home and small office networks to link devices together and to a wireless router to connect them to the Internet, and in wireless access points in public places like coffee shops, hotels, libraries, and airports to provide visitors with Internet connectivity for their mobile devices.\nWi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, which restricts the use of the term \"Wi-Fi Certified\" to products that successfully complete interoperability certification testing. As of 2017, the Wi-Fi Alliance consisted of more than 800 companies from around the world. As of 2019, over 3.05 billion Wi-Fi-enabled devices are shipped globally each year.Wi-Fi uses multiple parts of the IEEE 802 protocol family and is designed to work seamlessly with its wired sibling, Ethernet. Compatible devices can network through wireless access points with each other as well as with wired devices and the Internet. Different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with different radio technologies determining radio bands, maximum ranges, and speeds that may be achieved. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the 2.4 gigahertz (120 mm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (60 mm) SHF radio bands; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks, but, within range, only one transmitter can transmit on a channel at a time.\n\nWi-Fi's radio bands have relatively high absorption and work best for line-of-sight use. Many common obstructions such as walls, pillars, home appliances, etc. may greatly reduce range, but this also helps minimize interference between different networks in crowded environments. An access point range is about 20 m (66 ft) indoors, while some access points claim up to a 150 m (490 ft) range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves or as large as many square kilometres using many overlapping access points with roaming permitted between them. Over time, the speed and spectral efficiency of Wi-Fi have increased. As of 2019, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware at close range, can achieve speeds of 9.6 Gbit/s (gigabit per second).\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " IEEE 802.11: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11@@Internet access: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access@@Internet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet@@Wi-Fi Alliance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance@@IEEE 802: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802@@Ethernet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet\n\n^^^^^\n"}

He had originally accepted the commission from Pope Clement VII, but it was completed under Pope Paul III whose stronger reforming views probably affected the final treatment.In the lower part of the fresco, Michelangelo followed tradition in showing the saved ascending at the left and the damned descending at the right. In the upper part, the inhabitants of Heaven are joined by the newly saved. The fresco is more monochromatic than the ceiling frescoes and is dominated by the tones of flesh and sky. The cleaning and restoration of the fresco, however, revealed a greater chromatic range than previously apparent. Orange, green, yellow, and blue are scattered throughout, animating and unifying the complex scene.\nThe reception of the painting was mixed from the start, with much praise but also criticism on both religious and artistic grounds. Both the amount of nudity and the muscular style of the bodies has been one area of contention, and the overall composition another.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Last Judgment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment@@Michelangelo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo@@Sistine Chapel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel@@Vatican City: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City@@Second Coming of Christ: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming@@Christ: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus@@Sistine Chapel ceiling: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel_ceiling@@Pope Clement VII: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII@@Pope Paul III: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_III\n\n^^^^^\n"}

The painting was inspired by a chance comment by a judge, while at dinner with Landseer, that the French poodle belonging to amateur artist and renowned socialite, the Count d'Orsay, \"would make a capital Lord Chancellor\".\nLandseer was a member of the Royal Academy and had become famous for his paintings and drawings of animals.

{"prompt": "The Last Supper (1630\u20131631) is an oil painting by Peter Paul Rubens. It was commissioned by Catherine Lescuyer as a commemorative piece for her father. Rubens created it as part of an altarpiece in the Church of St. Rombout (Rumbold) in Mechelen. The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas dressed in blue turning back towards the viewer and away from the table. Other than Jesus, the most prominent figure is Judas. Judas holds his right hand to his mouth with his eyes avoiding direct contact with the other figures in the painting creating a nervous expression. Jesus is dressed in red and has a yellow halo surrounding his head with his face tilted upwards. Jesus is located centrally in the painting surrounded by his disciples with six on each side, and he holds a loaf of bread with a cup of wine in front of him. Out of all of the figures, he is the most in the light with the figures to the farthest left being the most in shadow. \u201cThe scene thus represents a perfect conflation of the theological significance of the Last Supper\u201d meaning the conflation between the blessing of the bread and the wine while still being pivotal in the sense of revealing the betrayal.As in many other Northern European depictions, a dog with a bone can be seen in the scene, probably a simple pet. It may represent  faith, dogs are traditionally symbols of and are representing faith. According to J. Richard Judson the dog near Judas perhaps represents greed or evil, as the companion of Judas, as in John 13:27.This painting followed the first unsuccessful attempt by Rubens to produce a Last Supper in 1611, when his patrons backed out the last minute, perhaps due to the high price of 4,000 Guilder asked by Rubens.Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper fresco was a significant influence on Rubens who created an etching after the Davinci Last Supper, which was one of Rubens' first attempts to express the full range of human emotion printed by Pieter Soutman. Rubens was also influenced by his humanist ideals from which he extracts biblical themes.Rubens often made engravings following the completion of his works. Other artists used these engravings to serve as a basis of their own works. These copies were even collected. The engravings and copies helped to lead to the popularity of Rubens\u2019 works during his lifetime.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Last Supper: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Supper@@Peter Paul Rubens: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Paul_Rubens@@Rubens: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Paul_Rubens@@Mechelen: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechelen@@Jesus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus@@Guilder: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilder\n\n^^^^^\n"}

It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.\nThe garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Fran\u00e7ois Fr\u00e9zier in 1714.

{"prompt": "When Abortion Was Illegal: Untold Stories is a 1992 American short documentary film directed by Dorothy Fadiman. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.   The film consists of first person stories which reveal the physical, emotional and legal consequences of having or providing an abortion when it was a criminal act. The film is the first of three films called the Reproductive Rights Trilogy or \"From the Back Alleys to the Supreme Court & Beyond.\"\nOf making the film, Dorothy Fadiman said, \"While a student at Stanford, I had become unintentionally pregnant. I had no money, no committed partner and my family was 3,000 miles away. I could neither find or afford a skilled provider. Abortion was illegal in California (1962), so I paid $600 to a person whose face I never saw to terminate my pregnancy. I was blindfolded throughout the procedure. Soon afterward, I began to hemorrhage and ended up on the intensive care ward of Stanford hospital with a fever of 105. I could have died, like so many women who risked the back alleys or aborted themselves. In 1973, a Supreme Court decision affirmed that most abortions would be legal. 1991, now a documentary filmmaker, I realized that some members of the Supreme Court were so anti-abortion that they could vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Most people had no idea what the dangers of the back alleys had been. I decided to make a documentary based on what had happened to me, and to so many other women.

{"prompt": "K-pop (Korean: \ucf00\uc774\ud31d; RR: keipap), short for Korean popular music, is a form of popular music originating in South Korea as part of South Korean culture.  It includes styles and genres from around the world, such as pop, hip hop, R&B, rock, jazz, gospel, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, disco, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots. The term \"K-pop\" became popular in the 2000s, especially in the international context. The Korean term for domestic pop music is gayo (Korean: \uac00\uc694; Hanja: \u6b4c\u8b20), which is still widely used within South Korea.  While \"K-pop\" can refer to all popular music or pop music from South Korea, it is colloquially often used in a narrower sense for any Korean music and artists associated with the entertainment and idol industry in the country, regardless of the genre.\nThe more modern form of the genre, originally termed \"rap dance\", emerged with the formation of the hip hop boy band Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene.Modern K-pop \"idol\" culture began in the 1990s, as K-pop idol music grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and young adults. After a slump in early idol music, from 2003, TVXQ and BoA started a new generation of K-pop idols that broke the music genre into the neighboring Japanese market and continue to popularize K-pop internationally today. With the advent of online social networking services and South Korean TV shows, the current spread of K-pop and South Korean entertainment, known as the Korean Wave, is seen not only in East Asia and Southeast Asia, but also in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Latin America, North Africa, Southern Africa and East Africa, the Middle East and throughout the Western world, gaining an international audience.\nIn 2018, K-pop experienced significant growth and became a \"power player\", marking a 17.9% increase in revenue growth. As of 2019, Korean popular music is ranked at number six among the top ten music markets worldwide according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's \"Global Music Report 2019\", with BTS and Blackpink cited as artists leading the market growth.

{"prompt": "The delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is an endangered slender-bodied smelt, about 5 to 7 cm (2.0 to 2.8 in) long, in the family Osmeridae. Endemic to the upper Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary of California, it mainly inhabits the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone of the estuary, except during its spawning season, when it migrates upstream to fresh water following winter \"first flush\" flow events (around March to May). It functions as an indicator species for the overall health of the Delta's ecosystem.Because of its one-year lifecycle and relatively low fecundity, it is very susceptible to changes in the environmental conditions of its native habitat. Efforts to protect the endangered fish from further decline have focused on limiting or modifying the large-scale pumping activities of state and federal water projects at the southern end of the estuary, thereby limiting water available to farming. However, these efforts have not prevented the species from becoming functionally extinct in the wild.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Hypomesus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomesus@@Osmeridae: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelt_(fish)@@California: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "The thicktail chub (Gila crassicauda) was a type of minnow that inhabited the lowlands and weedy backwaters of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers in the Central Valley of California. It was once abundant in lowland lakes, marshes, ponds, slow-moving stretches of river, and, during years of heavy run-off, the surface waters of San Francisco Bay. The thicktail chub was one of the most common fish in California. Within Native American middens it represented 40% of the fish.The chub was a favored food of the native Indian peoples of Clear Lake and the Central Valley before being heavily exploited by commercial fishermen supplying the San Francisco market. A heavy-bodied fish with a thick tail and a small, cone-shaped head, the backs of the thicktail chub ranged in color from greenish brown to purplish black, while the sides and belly were yellow. It could reach a length of nearly ten inches. Although little is known about its behavior, it was probably carnivorous, feeding on small fish and invertebrates.\nThe primary cause of the thicktailed chub's extinction was the conversion of much of the Central Valley to agricultural use. Most of its habitat was destroyed by the drainage of sloughs and marshes, dam-building, and water diversion for irrigation. All this resulted in the loss of the sluggish water the species preferred. Competition from exotic species also contributed to its extinction. The last known example was caught on April 16, 1957.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " California: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California@@San Francisco Bay: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay@@Lake: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Then it flows through  a series of tunnels to an end in the foothills of eastern San Jose, 5 miles (8 km) from downtown San Jose, California.\nConstruction on the South Bay Aqueduct began in 1960. The Aqueduct was the first delivery system completed under the State Water Project and has been conveying water to Alameda County since 1962 and to Santa Clara County since 1965. The South Bay Aqueduct begins at Bethany Reservoir near Tracy, with the South Bay Pumping Plant lifting water 566 feet into the first reach of the Aqueduct. The South Bay's Pumping Plant's nine pumping units, with a combined capacity of 330 cubic feet per second, discharge water through two parallel buried pipelines to the eastern ridge of the Diablo Range.\nFrom there, water flows by gravity for nine miles to the 100 acre-foot Patterson Reservoir, where some water is released for delivery to Livermore Valley. Water flow then continues about nine miles to a junction point where a portion is diverted into a 1 1/2-mile branch line and pumped into Lake Del Valle.\nBeyond the Del Valle junction, the water flows by pipeline to La Costa Tunnel, proceeds southwest past Sunol, through the Mission Tunnel, then south through the hills overlooking San Francisco Bay.

After serving for two years as chairman of the military junta, he was elected president in 1963, ushering in the Third Republic. During his rule, Park began a series of economic reforms that eventually led to rapid economic growth and industrialization, now known as the Miracle on the Han River, giving South Korea one of the fastest growing national economies during the 1960s and 1970s, albeit with costs to economic inequality and labor rights. This era also saw the formation of chaebols, family companies supported by the state similar to the Japanese zaibatsu, with prominent examples including Hyundai, LG, and Samsung that remain dominant and influential in the country today.\nAlthough popular during the 1960s, Park's popularity started to plateau by the 1970s, with closer than expected victories during the 1971 presidential election and the subsequent legislative elections. In 1972, Park declared martial law and introduced the highly authoritarian Yushin Constitution, ushering in the Fourth Republic. Political opposition and dissent was now constantly repressed and Park had complete control of the military, and much control over the media and expressions of art. In 1979, Park was assassinated by close friend Kim Jae-gyu, director of the KCIA, following the Bu-Ma student demonstrations. Whether the assassination was spontaneous or premeditated remains unclear to this day. Economic growth continued in spite of the 1979 coup d'\u00e9tat and considerable political turmoil in the wake of his assassination. The country eventually democratized in 1987.\nPark ruled South Korea as an authoritarian dictator, and remains a controversial figure in modern South Korean political discourse and among the South Korean populace in general, making a detached evaluation of his tenure difficult. While some credit him for sustaining economic growth, which reshaped and modernized South Korea, others criticize his authoritarian way of ruling the country (especially after 1971) and for prioritizing economic growth and social order at the expense of civil liberties and human rights. A Gallup Korea poll in October 2021 showed Park, Kim Dae-jung (an old opponent of Park that he tried to have executed), and Roh Moo-hyun as the most highly rated presidents of South Korean history in terms of leaving a positive legacy, especially among right-wing conservatives and the elderly. Park's eldest daughter Park Geun-hye later served as the 11th president of South Korea from 2013 until she was impeached and convicted of various corruption charges in 2017.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " President of South Korea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Korea@@Miracle on the Han River: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_the_Han_River@@South Korea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea@@LG: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corporation@@Samsung: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung@@Yushin Constitution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Republic_of_Korea@@Kim Jae-gyu: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jae-gyu@@Korea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea@@Kim Dae-jung: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Dae-jung@@Roh Moo-hyun: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roh_Moo-hyun@@Park Geun-hye: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Geun-hye\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Teen pop incorporates different subgenres of pop music, as well as elements of R&B, dance, electronic, hip hop and rock, while the music of girl groups, boy bands, and acts like Britney Spears, is sometimes referred to as pure pop. Typical characteristics of teen pop music include Auto-Tuned or pitch-corrected vocals, choreographed dances, emphasis on visual appeal (photogenic faces, unique body physiques, immaculate hair styles and fashion clothes), lyrics focused on love, relationships, dancing, partying, friendship, puppy love (also known as a \"crush\") and repeated chorus lines. Its lyrics also incorporate sexual innuendo. Teen pop singers often cultivate an image of a girl next door/boy next door.According to AllMusic, teen pop \"is essentially dance-pop, pop, and urban ballads\" that are marketed to teens, and was conceived in its contemporary form during the late 1980s and 1990s, pointing out the late 1990s as \"arguably the style's golden era.\" About.com's Bill Lamb described teen pop sound as \"a simple, straightforward, ultra-catchy melody line [...] The songs may incorporate elements of other pop music genres, but usually they will never be mistaken for anything but mainstream pop. The music is designed for maximum focus on the performer and a direct appeal to listeners.\"In Crazy About You: Reflections on the Meanings of Contemporary Teen Pop Music (2002), Phillip Vannini and Scott M.

Identifying factors usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse\u2013chorus structure), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to.

The prevalence of this personality type in a population varies from culture to culture, as a person's upbringing and education play a strong role in determining whether somebody develops this sort of personality.The right-wing authoritarian personality was defined by Bob Altemeyer as a refinement of the research of Theodor Adorno. Adorno was the first to propose the existence of an authoritarian personality as part of an attempt to explain the rise of fascism and the Holocaust, but his theory fell into disfavor because it was based on Freudian pseudo-science. Altemeyer nonetheless felt that Adorno was on to something, and so developed a more scientifically rigorous theory.\nThe RWA scale was designed to measure authoritarianism in North America. It has proven to be similarly reliable in English-speaking countries such as Australia, but some versions like the \"RWA Short Scale\" has been less effective in other countries such as France due to being optimised for english-speaking cultural differences and translation issues.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Bob Altemeyer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Altemeyer@@Theodor Adorno: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_W._Adorno\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Unlike the other schools of criminology, there is less emphasis on developing theories of causality in relation to crime and deviance (the tendency is to scientifically examine Official Statistics as evidence). The school employs a rationalist, direct and scientific approach to policy-making for the prevention and control of crime. Some politicians who ascribe to the perspective may address aspects of crime policy in ideological terms by referring to freedom, justice, and responsibility. For example, they may be asserting that individual freedom should only be limited by a duty not to use force against others.

This suggestion of intimacy was supposedly wildly attractive to women, especially younger ones such as teenage girls, known at the time as \"bobby soxers\". The crooning style developed out of singers who performed with big bands, and reached its height in the 1940s to late 60s.\nCrooning is epitomised by jazz vocalists like Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, although Sinatra once said that he did not consider himself or Crosby to be \"crooners\".

They were considered by some to be avant-garde for their time and part of la Movida Madrile\u00f1a countercultural movement. They had a brief comeback in 1998.\nThe band's line-up was singer Ana Torroja and brothers Nacho and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cano, who worked alongside session musicians such as Arturo Terriza, Manolo Aguilar, Nacho Ma\u00f1\u00f3, Javier Qu\u00edlez, \u00c1ngel Celada and \u00d3scar Astruga. The trio's musical career spanned two distinct stages. The first, up to 1985, was essentially as a synthpop band, while in the second stage Mecano followed a more acoustic pop rock direction, with elements of ballad, dance, flamenco, bossa nova, tango, salsa, rumba flamenca, bolero, pasodoble, and even reggae.\nThe unprecedented success also hit Hispanic America. Also, thanks to adaptations to other languages of several of their songs, they influenced non-Spanish speaking countries such as Italy and France, as with their song \"Une femme avec une femme\". In 2005, Mecano's music was adapted into the successful musical Hoy no me puedo levantar, which opened productions in Spain and Mexico. After two years, it was announced that the musical had been seen by more than 1,500,000 spectators in both countries, making it the most successful original production in Spanish of all times.\nSome of their biggest number one singles include \"Me cuesta tanto olvidarte\", \"La fuerza del destino\", \"Hijo de la luna\", \"Cruz de navajas\", \"Une femme avec une femme\" (\"Mujer contra mujer\", a worldwide number one hit), and \"El 7 de septiembre\".\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Ana Torroja: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Torroja@@Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cano: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Cano@@Hispanic America: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_America@@Italy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy@@Une femme avec une femme: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Une_femme_avec_une_femme@@Hoy no me puedo levantar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoy_no_me_puedo_levantar@@Mexico: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico@@Hijo de la luna: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijo_de_la_Luna\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Originally founded in the small town Rosa Morada in the municipality of Mocorito, Sinaloa, Mexico, with sales of 60 million albums, the band is one of the most recognized groups in the genre, due to its long history and its successes within the Mexican community in the diaspora. The band is famous for its political corridos, some of which have been censored, even in its own country. The band is the only Mexican group to win 6 Grammy awards and 12 Latin Grammys. In addition, the band has made 40 films alongside the Almada brothers (Mario and Fernando) among other well-known Mexican actors.\nThe band's style is based on regional music of Mexico, using mainly instruments such as the electric bass (or double bass), accordion, bass, drums, and sometimes other percussion instruments. The lyrics in their songs fluctuate between the romantic and the corrido. In recent years the band has begun to make music in a new genre called narcocorrido, in which they narrate the experience of members of drug gangs operating in Mexico. The narcocorrido song \"Death Announced\", for example, stands out, as it is dedicated to the legendary Colombian drug trafficker Pablo Escobar, \"El Jefe de Jefes.\" In that song, the band tells the story of the power and influence of the now imprisoned Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo. Another of their famous narcocorridos, \"The Queen of the South\", is based on a literary novel by Arturo P\u00e9rez-Reverte from which a television series was made based on the Spanish writer's work. They have become famous in Mexico and the United States, especially in California and Texas, mainly due to the large number of Mexicans living there. They also have found considerable fame in Colombia.\nThe band won a Grammy Award in 1988 for their album Gracias, Am\u00e9rica sin Fronteras, and twelve years later their album Herencia de Familia won the award for Best Norte\u00f1o Album at the first ever Latin Grammys.

{"prompt": "Social interventionism is an action which involves the deliberate intervention of a public or private organization into social affairs for the purpose of changing them. In other words, it is a deliberate attempt to change society in some way, \"an alteration of the social structure\".David Lloyd Hoffmann describes social interventionism as one of the two defining features of modernity and modern political systems (the second feature being mass politics). According to Hoffmann, a general ethos of social intervention arose across Europe by the 19th century, in which both state officials and non-governmental professionals working for charitable institutions or private companies tried to reshape their societies in accordance with scientific or aesthetic norms. This new ethos was based upon Enlightenment rationalism, with its belief that human society can and should be improved through the application of reason, as well as 17th century cameralism that pioneered the use of statistics and data in making government decisions. Social interventions could take many forms depending on the ideology of the people or institutions undertaking them, and both the left and right wings of European politics supported the broad idea of social interventionism, though they disagreed on how society should be improved and what \"improvement\" meant. Therefore, social interventionism is not defined as a specific set of goals or policies, but rather as the \"impulse to manage society through the application of bureaucratic procedures and categories\", or the \"rational design of social order commensurate with the scientific understanding of natural laws\".In the late 20th century, with the rise of the Washington Consensus, social interventionism fell out of favor in international political thought.Academic research of social interventions occurs in many public policy schools around the world. Some universities also have dedicated research centres or clusters covering Social Intervention, for example the Department of Social Policy and Intervention at the University of Oxford.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Washington Consensus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus@@Department of Social Policy and Intervention: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Policy_and_Intervention@@University of Oxford: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Other definitions may include Mongolia and Singapore, because of limited historical Chinese influences or increasing modern-day Chinese diaspora. The East Asian cultural sphere is not to be confused with the Sinophone world, which includes countries where the Chinese-speaking population is dominant.Imperial China was a regional power and exerted influence on tributary states and neighboring states, among which were Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. These interactions brought ideological and cultural influences rooted in Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. During classical history, the four cultures shared a common imperial system under respective emperors. Chinese inventions influenced, and were in turn influenced by, innovations of the other cultures in governance, philosophy, science, and the arts. Written Classical Chinese became the regional lingua franca for literary, cultural, scientific, and economic exchange, and Chinese characters (Hanzi) became locally adapted in Japan as Kanji, Korea as Hanja, and Vietnam as ch\u1eef H\u00e1n.In late classical history, the literary importance of classical Chinese diminished as Japan, Korea, and Vietnam each adopted their own literary device. Japan developed the Katakana and Hiragana scripts, Korea created Hangul, and Vietnam developed ch\u1eef N\u00f4m (which is now rarely used; the modern Vietnamese alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet).

{"prompt": "The National Union (Portuguese: Uni\u00e3o Nacional) was the sole legal party of the Estado Novo regime in Portugal, founded in July 1930 and dominated by Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar during most of its existence.\nUnlike in most single-party regimes, the National Union was more of a political arm of the government rather than holding actual power over it. The National Union membership was mostly drawn from local notables: landowners, professionals and businessmen, Catholics, monarchists or conservative republicans. The National Union was never a militant or very active organization.Once Salazar assumed the premiership, the National Union became the only party legally allowed to function under the Estado Novo. Salazar announced that the National Union would be the antithesis of a political party. The NU became an ancillary body, not a source of political power. At no stage did it appear that Salazar wished it to fulfill the central role the Fascist Party had acquired in Mussolini's Italy; in fact, it was meant to be a platform of conservatism, not a revolutionary vanguard.The National Union's ideology was corporatism, and it took as many inspirations from Catholic encyclicals such as Rerum novarum and Quadragesimo anno as well as from Mussolini's corporate state. Compared to other ruling Fascist parties, the National Union played a much smaller role in its regime. The National Union was set up to control and restrain public opinion rather than to mobilize it, and ministers, diplomats and civil servants were never compelled to join the party.Scholarly opinion varies on whether the Estado Novo and the National Union should be considered fascist or not. Salazar himself criticized the \"exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organizing masses behind a single leader\" as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the Estado Novo. Scholars such as Stanley G. Payne, Thomas Gerard Gallagher, Juan Jos\u00e9 Linz, Ant\u00f3nio Costa Pinto, Roger Griffin, Robert Paxton and Howard J.

It was strongly anti-democratic, anti-capitalist, anti-communist, and anti-Semitic. It differed from other European right-wing movements of the period due to its spiritual basis, as the Iron Guard was deeply imbued with Romanian Orthodox Christian mysticism.\nIn March 1930, Codreanu formed the Iron Guard as a paramilitary branch of the Legion, which in 1935 changed its official name to the \"Totul pentru \u021aar\u0103\" party\u2014literally, \"Everything for the Country\". It existed into the early part of the Second World War, during which time it came to power. Members were called Legionnaires or, outside of the movement, \"Greenshirts\" because of the predominantly green uniforms they wore.When Marshal Ion Antonescu came to power in September 1940, he brought the Iron Guard into the government, creating the National Legionary State. In January 1941, following the Legionnaires' rebellion, Antonescu used the army to suppress the movement, destroying the organization; its commander, Horia Sima, along with other leaders, escaped to Germany.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Corneliu Zelea Codreanu: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneliu_Zelea_Codreanu@@Archangel Michael: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(archangel)@@Christian mysticism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism@@Ion Antonescu: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Antonescu@@National Legionary State: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Legionary_State@@Horia Sima: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horia_Sima\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "The National Unity Party of Canada (NUPC) was a Canadian far-right political party which based its ideology on Adolf Hitler's Nazism and Benito Mussolini's fascism. It was founded as the Parti national social chr\u00e9tien du Canada (PNSC) by Nazi sympathizer Adrien Arcand on February 22, 1934. The party's activities were originally limited to Quebec, but it later expanded to Ontario and Western Canada. Party membership swelled in the mid-to-late 1930s as the party absorbed smaller fascist groups across the country. Following the outbreak of World War II, the Canadian government banned the NUPC on May 30, 1940, under the Defence of Canada Regulations of the War Measures Act. Arcand and many of his followers were consequently arrested and interned for the duration of the war.\nThe ban on the NUPC was lifted following the war's end in 1945, and the party resumed its activities shortly afterwards. However, its public presence greatly diminished after the war and all but disappeared following Arcand's death in 1967. The 1949 federal election was the only election ever contested by the NUPC; Arcand ran in the Quebec riding of Richelieu\u2014Verch\u00e8res and placed second, receiving a little over 29 per cent of the vote.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Adolf Hitler: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler@@Nazism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism@@Benito Mussolini: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini@@Adrien Arcand: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien_Arcand@@Quebec: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec@@Ontario: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario@@Western Canada: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Canada@@World War II: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II@@Defence of Canada Regulations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_of_Canada_Regulations@@War Measures Act: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Measures_Act@@Richelieu\u2014Verch\u00e8res: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richelieu%E2%80%94Verch%C3%A8res\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "The Canadian Fascist Party was a fascist political party based in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in the 1930s. The formative core of the party was a splinter group from the Canadian Nationalist Party that found the principles of corporatism to be more important than the largely racial motivations of the Nationalist Party. This disposition is highlighted in one official statement that \"anti-semitism was a symptom of Germany not of Fascism\". The party was founded as the British Empire Union of Fascists and was affiliated with the British Union of Fascists. It later became known as the Canadian Union of Fascists and Canadian Union.  It published its own newspaper, The Thunderbolt.\nThe party was led by \"Chuck\" Crate, who became leader at the age of 17. He had contacted the British Union of Fascists, who put him in touch with the party. John Ross Taylor of Toronto became the party's secretary and organizer.The party had a hard time attracting supporters because most Canadians who supported fascism leaned towards the racist brand espoused by Adrien Arcand and others. At the party's first meeting, there was an attendance of roughly 200 people.This disparity between the party and Arcand's would continue throughout its existence. Before the government took action against Canadian fascist parties, the Canadian Union of Fascists and Arcand's group held simultaneous fascist congresses in Toronto. While Arcand's group, dubbed the \"National Union\" drew a crowd of around 4,000, the Canadian Union managed to draw only some 30 local residents to its cause.The party was dissolved when the Second World War began. The party told its members to obey the law but to work for a negotiated peace. Crate escaped a treason charge and ended up in the Royal Canadian Navy.\nThe party, though not officially racist or anti-semitic, had strong connections to Adrien Arcand's National Unity Party.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Fascist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism@@Winnipeg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg@@Canadian Nationalist Party: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Nationalist_Party@@Fascism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism@@British Union of Fascists: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Union_of_Fascists@@John Ross Taylor: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ross_Taylor@@Toronto: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto@@Adrien Arcand: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien_Arcand@@Second World War: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II@@Royal Canadian Navy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Navy\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Established in 1981, CAFE states that it is committed to the promotion and defense of total freedom of speech, and publishes the Free Speech Monitor ten times a year. Although it began in Ontario, it has also been incorporated in Alberta.\nOpponents have accused CAFE of racism, arguing that it does not merely support the free speech rights of far right groups, but also promotes their views.CAFE has criticized what it considers injustices against white people in Canada, and has argued that Canadian laws do not robustly defend the free speech of whites, and are too weighted in favour of minorities. CAFE has campaigned (along with the defunct white nationalist groups Canadian Heritage Alliance and Northern Alliance) for the release of Brad Love, whom it claimed was jailed for expressing his nativist sentiments. CAFE has also campaigned for the release of Holocaust deniers Ernst Z\u00fcndel and David Irving, and against human rights lawyer Richard Warman and the Canadian Human Rights Commission. \nOn November 23, 2007, Ontario Superior Court Justice Monique M\u00e9tivier ruled that Fromm and CAFE had libelled Warman, and ordered them to pay $30,000 in damages and to post full retractions within ten days on all the websites on which the defamatory comments were posted. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the judgment in December 2008 with damages being raised to $40,000, as Fromm was ordered to pay an additional $10,000 towards Warman's legal costs. Warman said the appeal court's ruling \"sends the message that those who try to use the cloak of free speech to poison other people's reputations through lies and defamation do so at their own peril.\"CAFE was an intervenor in Oger v Whatcott, a hearing before the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal regarding harassment of Ms. Oger by Mr. Whatcott, who Ms. Oger alleged ran a very public campaign of harassment against her on the basis of her gender identity. CAFE supported Mr. Whatcott's right to make those statements, and adopted many of Mr. Whatcott's statements in its submissions to the Tribunal.

{"prompt": "Falangism in Latin America has been a feature of political life since the 1930s as movements looked to the national syndicalist clerical fascism of the Spanish state and sought to apply it to other Spanish-speaking countries.

After the war, he studied law and political science at the University of Munich and the University of Freiburg, where he first got involved in politics.

Malaparte is best known outside Italy due to his works Kaputt (1944) and La pelle (1949). The former is a semi-fictionalised account of the Eastern Front during the Second World War and the latter is an account focusing on morality in the immediate post-war period of Naples (it was placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum).\nDuring the 1920s, Malaparte was one of the intellectuals who supported the rise of Italian fascism and Benito Mussolini, through the magazine 900. Despite this, Malaparte had a complex relationship with the National Fascist Party and was stripped of membership in 1933 for his independent streak. Arrested numerous times, he had Casa Malaparte created in Capri where he lived under house arrest. After the Second World War, he became a filmmaker and moved closer to both Togliatti's Italian Communist Party and the Catholic Church (though once a staunch atheist), reputedly becoming a member of both before his death.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Second World War: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II@@Naples: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples@@Index Librorum Prohibitorum: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum@@Italian fascism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fascism@@Benito Mussolini: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini@@National Fascist Party: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Fascist_Party@@Casa Malaparte: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Malaparte@@Capri: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri@@Italian Communist Party: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Communist_Party@@Catholic Church: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Coloured terminology is occasionally found in Graeco-Roman ethnography and other ancient and medieval sources, but these societies did not have any notion of a white or pan-European race. In Graeco-Roman society whiteness was a somatic norm, although this norm could be rejected and it did not coincide with any system of discrimination or colour prejudice. Historically, before the late modern period, cultures outside of Europe and North America, such as those in the Middle East and China, employed concepts of whiteness. Eventually these were progressively marginalised and replaced by the European form of racialised whiteness. Whiteness has no enduring \"true essence\", but instead is a social construct that is dependent on differing societal, geographic, and historical meanings.

{"prompt": "Jiang Qing (19 March 1914 \u2013 14 May 1991), also known as Madame Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary, actress, and major political figure during the Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976). She was the fourth wife of Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Communist Party and Paramount leader of China. She used the stage name Lan Ping (\u85cd\u860b) during her acting career (which ended in 1938), and was known by many other names. Jiang was best known for playing a major role in the Cultural Revolution and for forming the radical political alliance known as the \"Gang of Four\".\nJiang married Mao in Yan'an in November 1938 and served as the inaugural \"First Lady\" of the People's Republic of China. She served as Mao's personal secretary in the 1940s and was head of the Film Section of the Communist Party's Propaganda Department in the 1950s. Jiang served as an important emissary for Mao in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. In 1966, she was appointed deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. She collaborated with Lin Biao to advance Mao's unique brand of Communist ideology as well as Mao's cult of personality. At the height of the Cultural Revolution, Jiang held significant influence in the affairs of state, particularly in the realm of culture and the arts, and was idolized in propaganda posters as the \"Great Flagbearer of the Proletarian Revolution\". In 1969, Jiang gained a seat on the Politburo. Before Mao's death, the Gang of Four controlled many of China's political institutions, including the media and propaganda. However, Jiang, deriving most of her political legitimacy from Mao, often found herself at odds with other top leaders.\nMao's death in 1976 dealt a significant blow to Jiang's political fortunes. She was arrested in October 1976 by Hua Guofeng and his allies, and was subsequently condemned by party authorities. Since then, Jiang has been officially branded as having been part of the \"Lin Biao and Jiang Qing Counter-Revolutionary Cliques\" (\u6797\u5f6a\u6c5f\u9752\u53cd\u9769\u547d\u96c6\u56e2), to which most of the blame for the damage and devastation caused by the Cultural Revolution was assigned.

{"prompt": "Tristan und Isolde (Tristan and Isolde), WWV 90, is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner to a German libretto by the composer, based largely on the 12th-century romance Tristan and Iseult by Gottfried von Strassburg. It was composed between 1857 and 1859 and premiered at the K\u00f6nigliches Hoftheater und Nationaltheater in Munich on 10 June 1865 with Hans von B\u00fclow conducting. Wagner referred to the work not as an opera, but called it \"eine Handlung\" (literally a drama, a plot, or an action).\nWagner's composition of Tristan und Isolde was inspired by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer (particularly The World as Will and Representation), as well as by Wagner's affair with Mathilde Wesendonck. Widely acknowledged as a pinnacle of the operatic repertoire, Tristan was notable for Wagner's unprecedented use of chromaticism, tonal ambiguity, orchestral colour, and harmonic suspension.\nThe opera was enormously influential among Western classical composers and provided direct inspiration to composers such as Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, and Benjamin Britten. Other composers like Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Igor Stravinsky formulated their styles in contrast to Wagner's musical legacy. Many see Tristan as a milestone on the move away from common practice harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century. Both Wagner's libretto style and music were also profoundly influential on the symbolist poets of the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Tristan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan@@Tristan and Isolde: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_and_Iseult@@Richard Wagner: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner@@Tristan and Iseult: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_and_Iseult@@Gottfried von Strassburg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_von_Strassburg@@Hans von B\u00fclow: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_von_B%C3%BClow@@Arthur Schopenhauer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer@@The World as Will and Representation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation@@Mathilde Wesendonck: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathilde_Wesendonck@@Gustav Mahler: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Mahler@@Richard Strauss: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Strauss@@Alban Berg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alban_Berg@@Arnold Schoenberg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg@@Benjamin Britten: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Britten@@Claude Debussy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy@@Maurice Ravel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ravel@@Igor Stravinsky: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky\n\n^^^^^\n"}

A second election in 1990 resulted in the election of a majority of anti-Sandinista parties and the FSLN handing over power.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Revolution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution@@Somoza: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somoza_family@@Sandinista National Liberation Front: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista_National_Liberation_Front@@FSLN: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista_National_Liberation_Front@@Nicaragua: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua@@United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States@@Contras: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras@@Cold War: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War@@Soviet Union: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union\n\n^^^^^\n"}

In the early 1980s, it became the first independent labor union in a Soviet-bloc country. Solidarity gave rise to a broad, non-violent, anti-Communist social movement that, at its height, claimed some 9.4 million members. It is considered to have contributed greatly to the Fall of Communism.\nThe People's Republic of Poland attempted to destroy the union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression but in the end was forced into negotiation. The Roundtable Talks between the Communist government and the Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections of 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and Wa\u0142\u0119sa was elected president in December 1990. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the Communist governmental system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. Solidarity's early survival represented a break in the hard-line stance of the Communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and was an unprecedented event; not only for the People's Republic of Poland\u2014a satellite of the Soviet Union ruled by a one-party Communist state\u2014but for the whole of the Eastern Bloc. Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-Communist ideas and movements throughout the Eastern Bloc, weakening Communist governments. This process later culminated in the Revolutions of 1989.\nIn the 1990s, Solidarity's influence on politics of Poland waned. A political arm of the Solidarity movement, Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS), was founded in 1996 and would win the 1997 Polish parliamentary election, only to lose the subsequent 2001 Polish parliamentary election. Thereafter, Solidarity had little influence as a political party, though it became the largest trade union in Poland.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Gda\u0144sk: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk@@Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lech_Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa@@Soviet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union@@Fall of Communism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989@@People's Republic of Poland: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_People%27s_Republic@@Polish United Workers' Party: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_United_Workers%27_Party@@Soviet Union: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union@@Communist state: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state@@Eastern Bloc: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc@@Revolutions of 1989: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989@@Solidarity Electoral Action: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_Electoral_Action@@1997 Polish parliamentary election: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Polish_parliamentary_election@@2001 Polish parliamentary election: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Polish_parliamentary_election\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Charlton McIlwain defined the syndrome as \"white women occupying a privileged role as violent crime victims in news media reporting\", and posited that missing white woman syndrome functions as a type of racial hierarchy in the cultural imagery of the U.S. Eduardo Bonilla-Silva categorized the racial component of missing white woman syndrome as a \"form of racial grammar, through which white supremacy is normalized by implicit, or even invisible standards\".The phenomenon has led to a number of tough-on-crime measures, mainly on the political right, that were named for white women who disappeared and were subsequently found harmed. In addition to race and class, factors such as supposed attractiveness, body size, and youthfulness have been identified as unfair criteria in the determination of newsworthiness in coverage of missing women.

{"prompt": "In the context of the Spanish Empire, a peninsular (Spanish pronunciation: [peninsu\u02c8la\u027e], pl. peninsulares) was a Spaniard born in Spain residing in the New World, Spanish East Indies, or Spanish Guinea. Nowadays, the word peninsulares makes reference to Peninsular Spain and in contrast to the \"islanders\" (isle\u00f1os), from the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands or the territories of Ceuta and Melilla.\nA equivalent to the Spanish peninsulares in the Portuguese Colonial Brazil was the rein\u00f3is, Portuguese people born in Portugal, while Portuguese born in Brazil with both parents being rein\u00f3is were known as mazombos.\nSpaniards born in the Spanish Philippines were called insular/es or originally filipino/s, before \"Filipino\" now came to be known as all of the modern citizens of the now sovereign independent Philippines. Spaniards born in the colonies of the New World that today comprises the Hispanic America are called criollos (individuals of wholly European Spanish descent, but born in the New World).\nHigher offices in Spanish America and the Spanish Philippines were held by peninsulares. Apart from the distinction of peninsulares from criollo, the castas system distinguished also mestizos of mixed Spanish and Amerindian ancestry in the Americas, and 'mestizos de espa\u00f1ol' (mixed Spanish and native Filipino (Spanish Filipino)), or 'tornatras' (mixed Spanish and Sangley Chinese (Chinese Filipino)) in the Philippines / Spanish East Indies, mulatos (of mixed Spanish and black ancestry), indios (Amerindians / Native Filipinos), zambos (mixed Amerindian and black ancestry) and finally negros. In some places and times, such as during the wars of independence, peninsulares or members of conservative parties were called depreciatively godos (meaning Goths, referring to the \"Visigoths\", who had ruled Spain and were considered the origin of Spanish aristocracy) or, in Mexico, gachupines. Godos is still used pejoratively in the Canary Islands for the peninsular Spanish, and in Chile for Spaniards.Colonial officials at the highest levels arrived from Spain to fulfill their duty to govern Spanish colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. They defended C\u00e1diz's monopoly on trade, upsetting the criollos, who turned to contraband with British and French colonies, especially in areas away from the main ports of call for the Flota de Indias.

{"prompt": "Cuban foreign policy during the Cold War emphasized providing direct military assistance to friendly governments and resistance movements worldwide. This policy was justified directly by the Marxist concept of proletarian internationalism and was first articulated by Cuban leader Fidel Castro at the Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America in 1966. However, as an informal policy it had been adopted as early as 1959, shortly after the Cuban Revolution. It formed the basis for a number of Cuban military initiatives in Africa and Latin America, often carried out in direct conjunction with the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact member states which provided advisory or logistical support. These operations were often planned by the Cuban general staff through an overseas headquarters known as an internationalist mission.Military internationalism formed the crux of Cuba's foreign and military policy for almost three decades, and was subordinate only to domestic defense needs. Its support for resistance movements in Central America contributed to Cuba's diplomatic isolation in that region and was instrumental in triggering its suspension from the Organization of American States. Internationalist operations ranged from varying degrees of covert activity and espionage to the open commitment of combat troops on a large scale. The Cuban military presence in Africa was especially notable, with up to 50,000 troops being deployed to Angola alone.Cuban forces in Africa were mainly black and mulatto. Castro justified the use of the armed forces on the African continent as a result of the debt Cuba owed Africa due to its participation in the Atlantic slave trade and the contributions patriotic black Cubans had made to the Cuban War of Independence. Internationalist missions were perceived by the Cuban government as one means of combating the global influence of the United States by proxy, and Cuba's opponents during these efforts were often decried as American pawns. Likewise, the US government and its allies perceived the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) as a Soviet proxy, and the use of internationalist missions as a means to indirectly increase Soviet military influence worldwide. There were also more practical reasons for deploying Cuban troops abroad, such as giving the relatively inexperienced armed forces combat experience across a wide range of theaters.By the mid 1980s, a quarter of Cuba's total military strength was committed to its internationalist missions, fighting with socialist governments or factions in various civil conflicts. At least 200,000 Cuban citizens had served overseas with the FAR in a number of capacities. Military internationalism ended with the  dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, which curtailed much-needed Soviet logistical and financial support needed to sustain Cuba's foreign expeditions. The FAR terminated all its major overseas commitments between September 1989 and May 1991.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Cold War: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War@@Fidel Castro: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro@@Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_Solidarity_with_the_People_of_Asia,_Africa_and_Latin_America@@Cuban Revolution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution@@Africa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa@@Latin America: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America@@Soviet Union: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union@@Warsaw Pact: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact@@Cuba: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba@@Central America: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America@@Organization of American States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_American_States@@Angola: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola@@Atlantic slave trade: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade@@Cuban War of Independence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_War_of_Independence@@Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolutionary_Armed_Forces\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "Cuba intervened into numerous conflicts during the Cold War and sent medical and military aid into foreign countries on various occasions. The interventionist policies of Cuba during the Cold War were controversial and resulted in isolation. Cuban leader Fidel Castro held power to militarily intervene in other countries that he perceived to be ruled by a tyrant or despot. Castro justified intervention into foreign conflicts stating: \"Our Revolution is not a revolution of millionaires. Instead, it is one carried out by the poor, and is one which dreams of ensuring the well-being not only of our own poor, but rather of all the poor in this world. And that is why we talk of internationalism.\"With Soviet backing, Cuba extended support to indigenous groups fighting for independence in Algeria, and in the then-Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique as well as to the governments of newly independent African countries like Benin, Republic of the Congo (then Congo Brazzaville), Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Mali. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and facing the economic difficulties during the Special Period, Cuba's methods of military intervention were severely affected. Cuba has instead adopted other methods of intervening in foreign territories.Cuban medical internationalism was a prominent feature of Cuban interventions, alongside military aspects. Medical internationalism consisted of four prevailing approaches: emergency response medical teams sent overseas, establishment abroad of public health systems for providing free health care for local residents, taking in foreign patients to Cuba for free treatment, and providing medical training for foreigners in Cuba and overseas.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Cuba: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba@@Cold War: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War@@Fidel Castro: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro@@Algeria: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria@@Portuguese colonies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire@@Benin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin@@Republic of the Congo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo@@Egypt: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt@@Ghana: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana@@Guinea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea@@Guinea-Bissau: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea-Bissau@@Mali: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali@@Soviet Union: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union@@Special Period: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Period@@Cuban medical internationalism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_medical_internationalism\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Hayes was an enrolled member of the Gila River Indian Community, located in Pinal and Maricopa counties in Arizona. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve on August 26, 1942, and, after recruit training, volunteered to become a Paramarine. He fought in the Bougainville and Iwo Jima campaigns in the Pacific War.\nHayes was generally known as one of the six flag raisers immortalized in the iconic photograph Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima by photographer Joe Rosenthal. The first flag raised over Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945 at the south end of Iwo Jima, was deemed too small and replaced the same day by a larger flag. A photo of the second flag-raising, which included Hayes in it, became famous and was widely reproduced. After the battle, Hayes and two other men were identified as surviving second flag-raisers and were reassigned to help raise funds for the Seventh War Loan drive. In 1946, after his service in the Marine Corps, he was instrumental in revealing the correct identity of one of the Marines in the photograph.\nAfter the war, Hayes suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and descended into alcoholism. On November 10, 1954, he attended the dedication of the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, which was modeled after the photograph of Hayes and five other Marines raising the second flag on Iwo Jima. After a night of heavy drinking on January 23\u201324, 1955, he died of exposure to cold and alcohol poisoning. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on February 2, 1955.\nHayes was commemorated in art and film, before and after his death. In 1949, he portrayed himself raising the flag in the movie Sands of Iwo Jima, starring John Wayne. He was the subject of an article by journalist William Bradford Huie, which was adapted for the feature film The Outsider (1961), starring Tony Curtis as Hayes.

{"prompt": "Cyrus II of Persia (c.\u2009600\u2013530 BC; Old Persian: \ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfbd\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfc1 K\u016bru\u0161), commonly known as Cyrus the Great, was the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, the first Persian empire. Under his rule, the empire embraced all of the previous civilized states of the ancient Near East, expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of Western Asia and much of Central Asia. Spanning from the Mediterranean Sea and Hellespont in the west to the Indus River in the east, the empire created by Cyrus was the largest the world had yet seen. At its maximum extent under his successors, the Achaemenid Empire stretched from parts of the Balkans (Eastern Bulgaria\u2013Paeonia and Thrace\u2013Macedonia) and Southeast Europe proper in the west to the Indus Valley in the east.\nThe reign of Cyrus lasted about thirty years; his empire took root with his conquests of the Median Empire, then the Lydian Empire and eventually the Neo-Babylonian Empire. He also led an expedition into Central Asia, which resulted in major campaigns that were described as having brought \"into subjection every nation without exception\". Cyrus did not venture into Egypt, and was alleged to have died in battle while fighting the Massagetae, an ancient Eastern Iranian nomadic tribal  confederation, along the Syr Darya in December 530 BC. However, Xenophon claimed that Cyrus did not die in battle and returned to the Achaemenid ceremonial capital of Persepolis again. He was succeeded by his son, Cambyses II, who managed to conquer Egypt, Nubia and Cyrenaica during his short rule.\nKnown as Cyrus the Elder (Greek: \u039a\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03a0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b2\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, translit. K\u0177ros ho Presb\u00fdteros) to the Greeks, he was well-known for having respected the customs and religions of the lands he conquered. He was important in developing the system of a central administration at Pasargadae governing satraps in the empire's border regions, which worked very effectively and profitably for both rulers and subjects. The Edict of Restoration, a proclamation attested by a cylinder seal in which Cyrus authorized and encouraged the return of the Israelites to the Land of Israel following his conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, is described in the Bible and likewise left a lasting legacy on the Jewish religion due to his role in ending the Babylonian captivity and facilitating the Jewish return to Zion. According to Isaiah 45:1 of the Hebrew Bible, God anointed Cyrus for this task, even referring to him as a messiah (lit.\u2009'anointed one'); Cyrus is the only non-Jewish figure in the Bible to be revered in this capacity.Cyrus is also recognized for his achievements in human rights, politics, and military strategy, as well as his influence on both Eastern and Western civilizations. The Achaemenid influence in the ancient world would eventually extend as far as Athens, where upper-class Athenians adopted aspects of the culture of the ruling class of Achaemenid Persia as their own. Having originated from Persis, roughly corresponding to the modern-day Fars Province of Iran, Cyrus has played a crucial role in defining the national identity of modern Iran. He remains a cult figure amongst modern Iranians, with his tomb serving as a spot of reverence for millions of people. In the 1970s, the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, identified Cyrus' famous proclamation inscribed onto the Cyrus Cylinder as the oldest-known declaration of human rights, and the Cylinder has since been popularized as such. This view has been criticized by some Western historians as a misunderstanding of the Cylinder's generic nature as a traditional statement that new monarchs make at the beginning of their reign.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Cyrus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus@@Old Persian: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Persian@@Achaemenid Empire: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire@@Western Asia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Asia@@Central Asia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia@@Mediterranean Sea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea@@Indus River: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_River@@Balkans: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans@@Thrace: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrace@@Southeast Europe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Europe@@Median Empire: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes@@Neo-Babylonian Empire: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Babylonian_Empire@@Egypt: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt@@Massagetae: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massagetae@@Syr Darya: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syr_Darya@@Xenophon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon@@Achaemenid: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire@@Persepolis: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis@@Cambyses II: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambyses_II@@Nubia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubia@@Cyrenaica: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica@@Pasargadae: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasargadae@@Israelites: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites@@Land of Israel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel@@Bible: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible@@Babylonian captivity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity@@Isaiah 45:1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_45@@Hebrew Bible: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible@@Persis: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persis@@Fars Province: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fars_province@@Iran: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran@@Mohammad Reza Pahlavi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi@@Cyrus Cylinder: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Cylinder\n\n^^^^^\n"}

Computer addiction is not currently included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as an official disorder. The concept of computer addiction is broadly divided into two types, namely offline computer addiction, and online computer addiction. Offline computer addiction is normally used when speaking about excessive gaming behavior, which can be practiced both offline and online. Online computer addiction, also known as Internet addiction, gets more attention in general from scientific research than offline computer addiction, mainly because most cases of computer addiction are related to the excessive use of the Internet.Experts on Internet addiction have described this syndrome as an individual working intensely on the Internet, prolonged use of the Internet, uncontrollable use of the Internet, unable to use the Internet in an efficient, timely matter, not being interested in the outside world, not spending time with people from the outside world, and an increase in their loneliness and dejection.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Computer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer@@Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders@@DSM-5: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5@@Internet addiction: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_addiction_disorder\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "The Grand Budapest Hotel is a 2014 comedy-drama film written and directed by Wes Anderson. Ralph Fiennes leads a seventeen-actor ensemble cast as Monsieur Gustave H., famed concierge of a twentieth-century mountainside resort in the fictional Eastern European country of Zubrowka. When Gustave is framed for the murder of a wealthy dowager (Tilda Swinton), he and his recently befriended prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zero (Tony Revolori) embark on a quest for fortune and a priceless Renaissance painting amidst the backdrop of an encroaching fascist regime. Anderson's American Empirical Pictures produced the film in association with Studio Babelsberg, Fox Searchlight Pictures, and Indian Paintbrush's Scott Rudin and Steven Rales. Fox Searchlight supervised the commercial distribution, and The Grand Budapest Hotel's funding was sourced through Indian Paintbrush and German government-funded tax rebates.\nAnderson and longtime collaborator Hugo Guinness conceived The Grand Budapest Hotel as a fragmented tale following a character inspired by a common friend. They initially struggled in their brainstorming, but the experience touring Europe and researching the literature of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig shaped their vision for the film. The Grand Budapest Hotel draws visually from Europe-set mid-century Hollywood films and the United States Library of Congress's photochrom print collection of alpine resorts. Filming took place in eastern Germany from January to March 2013. French composer Alexandre Desplat composed the symphonic, Russian folk-inspired score, which expanded on his early work with Anderson. The film explores themes of fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty, and further studies analyze the function of color as an important storytelling device.\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel premiered in competition at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival on February 6, 2014. The French theatrical release on February 26 preceded the film's global rollout, followed by releases in Germany, North America, and the United Kingdom on March 6\u20137. The Grand Budapest Hotel received highly positive reviews in the press. Critics distinguished the actors and the film's craftsmanship for praise, though occasional criticism centered on the film's approach to subject matter, fragmented storytelling, and characterization. It earned $173 million in box office revenue worldwide, Anderson's highest-grossing feature to date. The film was nominated for nine awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning four, and received numerous other accolades.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Budapest: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest@@Wes Anderson: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Anderson@@Ralph Fiennes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Fiennes@@Tilda Swinton: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilda_Swinton@@Tony Revolori: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Revolori@@Studio Babelsberg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babelsberg_Studio@@Searchlight Pictures: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures@@Scott Rudin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Rudin@@Steven Rales: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Rales@@Hugo Guinness: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Guinness@@Stefan Zweig: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Zweig@@Library of Congress: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress@@Alexandre Desplat: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Desplat@@64th Berlin International Film Festival: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64th_Berlin_International_Film_Festival@@87th Academy Awards: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/87th_Academy_Awards\n\n^^^^^\n"}

The film tells an alternate history story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's leadership\u2014one planned by Shosanna Dreyfus, a young French Jewish cinema proprietor, and the other by the British; but is ultimately conducted solely by a team of Jewish American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine. Christoph Waltz co-stars as Hans Landa, an SS colonel in charge of tracking down Raine's group. The title was inspired by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari's 1978 Euro War film The Inglorious Bastards, though Tarantino's film is not a remake of it.\nTarantino wrote the script in 1998, but struggled with the ending and chose instead to direct the two-part film Kill Bill. After directing Death Proof in 2007, Tarantino returned to work on Inglourious Basterds. A co-production of the United States and Germany, the film began principal photography in October 2008 and was filmed in Germany and France with a $70 million production budget. It premiered on May 20, 2009, at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival, and received a wide release in theaters in the United States and Europe in August 2009 by The Weinstein Company and Universal Pictures.\nInglourious Basterds grossed over $321.5 million in theaters worldwide, making it Tarantino's highest-grossing film to that point, until it was surpassed in box office by Django Unchained (2012) and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019). The film received generally positive reviews, with Waltz's performance as Hans Landa being singled out for praise, but some criticized the historical liberties taken. It also won multiple awards and nominations, among them eight Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay).

Neferhotep I was likely contemporaneous with kings Zimri-Lim of Mari and Hammurabi of Babylon. Little is known of his activities during his decade-long reign and the most important document surviving from his rule is a stela from Abydos recounting the fashioning of an image of Osiris and Neferhotep's determination that it be made \"as instructed by the gods at the beginning of time\".Towards the end of his reign, Neferhotep I shared the throne with his brother Sihathor, a coregency that lasted a few months to a year. Sihathor died shortly before Neferhotep, who probably then appointed another brother, Sobekhotep IV, as coregent.

{"prompt": "Mulan is a 2020 American fantasy action drama film produced by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by Niki Caro from a screenplay by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Lauren Hynek, and Elizabeth Martin, it is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1998 animated film of the same name, itself based on the Chinese folklore story Ballad of Mulan. The film stars Yifei Liu in the title role, alongside Donnie Yen, Tzi Ma, Jason Scott Lee, Yoson An, Ron Yuan, Gong Li, and Jet Li in supporting roles. In the film, Hua Mulan, the eldest daughter of an honored warrior, masquerades as a man to take her ailing father's place during a general conscription to counter the Rouran army in Imperial China.\nPlans for a live-action remake began in 2010 but the project stalled in development hell for most of the decade. Filming took place in New Zealand and China from August to November 2018. Over the course of production, the film was the subject of several controversies, including changes to the source material and filming in Xinjiang in light of the Uyghur genocide and Xinjiang internment camps. The film also received criticism for its production team largely consisting of people of non-Chinese descent. This included the hiring of Caro, rather than an Asian director.\nMulan held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on March 9, 2020. The film was originally scheduled for a wide theatrical release later that month, but was cancelled in the United States after being delayed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, the film was released on September 4, 2020 by Disney+ for a premium fee known as Premier Access in countries where the service had launched. The film had a traditional theatrical release in countries without Disney+ where theaters had re-opened.\nDue to its overall limited theatrical release as a result of the pandemic, the film grossed $70 million at the box office against a production budget of $200 million. The film received generally positive reviews from Western, non-Asian critics, who praised the action sequences, costumes, and performances, but was criticized for the screenplay and editing. However, it received unfavorable reviews from fans of the original animated film, Chinese diaspora, and Chinese critics, who criticized the character development, its cultural and historical inaccuracies, and its depiction of Chinese people. At the 93rd Academy Awards and 26th Critics' Choice Awards, the film received nominations for its costume design and visual effects, as well as a Best Special Visual Effects nod at the 74th British Academy Film Awards.

Squatting occurs worldwide and tends to occur when people who are poor and homeless find empty buildings or land to occupy for housing. It has a long history, broken down by country below.\nIn developing countries and least developed countries, shanty towns often begin as squatted settlements. In African cities such as Lagos much of the population lives in slums. There are pavement dwellers in India and in Hong Kong as well as rooftop slums. Informal settlements in Latin America are known by names such as villa miseria (Argentina), pueblos j\u00f3venes (Peru) and asentamientos irregulares (Guatemala, Uruguay). In Brazil, there are favelas in the major cities and land-based movements.\nIn industrialized countries, there are often residential squats and also political squatting movements, which can be anarchist, autonomist or socialist in nature, for example in the self-managed social centres of Italy or squats in the United States. Oppositional movements from the 1960s and 1970s created freespaces in Denmark or squatting village in the Netherlands, and in England and Wales, there were estimated to be 50,000 squatters in the late 1970s.

{"prompt": "Biometrics are body measurements and calculations related to human characteristics. Biometric authentication (or realistic authentication) is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control. It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance.\nBiometric identifiers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals. Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological characteristics which are related to the shape of the body. Examples include, but are not limited to fingerprint, palm veins, face recognition, DNA, palm print, hand geometry, iris recognition, retina, odor/scent, voice, shape of ears and gait. Behavioral characteristics are related to the pattern of behavior of a person, including but not limited to mouse movement, typing rhythm, gait, signature, behavioral profiling, and credentials. Some researchers have coined the term behaviometrics to describe the latter class of biometrics.More traditional means of access control include token-based identification systems, such as a driver's license or passport, and knowledge-based identification systems, such as a password or personal identification number. Since biometric identifiers are unique to individuals, they are more reliable in verifying identity than token and knowledge-based methods; however, the collection of biometric identifiers raises privacy concerns about the ultimate use of this information.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Biometric: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics@@DNA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Management consulting is the practice of providing consulting services to organizations to improve their performance or in any way to assist in achieving organizational objectives. Organizations may draw upon the services of management consultants for a number of reasons, including gaining external (and presumably objective) advice and accessing consultants' specialized expertise regarding concerns that call for additional oversight.As a result of their exposure to and relationships with numerous organizations, consulting firms are typically aware of industry \"best practices\". However, the specific nature of situations under consideration may limit the ability or appropriateness of transferring such practices from one organization to another. Management consulting is an additional service to internal management functions and, for various legal and practical reasons, may not be seen as a replacement for internal management. Unlike interim management, management consultants do not become part of the organization to which they provide services.Consultancies provide organizational change management assistance, development of coaching skills, process analysis, technology implementation, strategy development, or operational improvement services.  Management consultants often bring their own proprietary methodologies or frameworks to guide the identification of problems and to serve as the basis for recommendations with a view to more effective or efficient ways of performing work tasks.The economic function of management consulting firms in general is to help and facilitate the development, rationalization and optimization of the various markets pertaining to the geographic areas and jurisdictions in which they operate.

He was the third American president to be assassinated, following Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and James A. Garfield in 1881.\nMcKinley enjoyed meeting the public and was reluctant to accept the security available to his office. Secretary to the President George B. Cortelyou feared that an assassination attempt would take place during a visit to the Temple of Music and took it off the schedule twice, but McKinley restored it each time.\nCzolgosz had lost his job during the economic Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy adhered to by recent assassins of foreign leaders. He regarded McKinley as a symbol of oppression and was convinced that it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him. He was unable to get near the president during an earlier visit, but he shot him twice as McKinley reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.\nMcKinley initially appeared to be recovering, but he took a turn for the worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous.

{"prompt": "In property law, title is an intangible construct representing a bundle of rights in (to) a piece of property in which a party may own either a legal interest or equitable interest. The rights in the bundle may be separated and held by different parties. It may also refer to a formal document, such as a deed, that serves as evidence of ownership. Conveyance of the document (transfer of title to the property) may be required in order to transfer ownership in the property to another person. Title is distinct from possession, a right that often accompanies ownership but is not necessarily sufficient to prove it (for example squatting). In many cases, possession and title may each be transferred independently of the other. For real property, land registration and recording provide public notice of ownership information.\nIn United States law, evidence of title is typically established through title reports written up by title insurance companies, which show the history of title (property abstract and chain of title) as determined by the recorded public record deeds; the title report will also show applicable encumbrances such as easements, liens, or covenants. In exchange for insurance premiums, the title insurance company conducts a title search through public records and provides assurance of good title, reimbursing the insured if a dispute over the title arises. In the case of vehicle ownership, a simple vehicle title document may be issued by a governmental agency.\nThe main rights in the title bundle are usually:\n\nExclusive possession\nExclusive use and enclosure\nAcquisition\nConveyance, including by bequest\nAccess easement\nHypothecation\nPartitionThe rights in real property may be separated further, examples including:\n\nWater rights, including riparian rights and runoff rights\nIn some U.S. states, water rights are completely separate from land\u2014see prior appropriation water rights\nMineral rights\nEasement to neighboring property, for utility lines, etc.\nTenancy or tenure in improvements\nTimber rights\nFarming rights\nGrazing rights\nHunting rights\nAir rights\nDevelopment rights to erect improvements under various restrictions\nAppearance rights, often subjected to local zoning ordinances and deed restrictionsPossession is the actual holding of a thing, whether or not one has any right to do so. The right of possession is the legitimacy of possession (with or without actual possession), evidence for which is such that the law will uphold it unless a better claim is proven. The right of property is that right which, if all relevant facts are known (and allowed), defeats all other claims.  Each of these may be in a different person.\nFor example, suppose A steals from B something that B had previously bought in good faith from C and that C had earlier stolen from D and that had been an heirloom of D's family for generations but had originally been stolen centuries earlier (though this fact is now forgotten by all) from E. Here A has the possession, B has an apparent right of possession (as evidenced by the purchase), D has the absolute right of possession (being the best claim that can be proven), and the heirs of E, if they knew it, would have the right of property, which they however could not prove. A good title consists of the combination of these three (possession, right of possession, and right of property) in the same person(s).\nThe extinguishing of ancient, forgotten, or unasserted claims, such as E's in the example above, was the original purpose of statutes of limitations. Otherwise, title to property would always be uncertain.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States@@Hypothecation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothec@@Water rights: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_right@@Mineral rights: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_rights@@Easement: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easement@@Tenancy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leasehold_estate@@Grazing rights: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazing_rights@@Hunting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting@@Air rights: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_rights\n\n^^^^^\n"}

It does not include the power to take and transfer ownership of private property from one property owner to another private property owner without a valid public purpose. This power can be legislatively delegated by the state to municipalities, government subdivisions, or even to private persons or corporations, when they are authorized by the legislature to exercise the functions of public character.The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain have been for roads, government buildings and public utilities. Many railroads were given the right of eminent domain to obtain land or easements in order to build and connect rail networks. In the mid-20th century, a new application of eminent domain was pioneered, in which the government could take the property and transfer it to a private third party for redevelopment. This was initially done only to a property that has been deemed \"blighted\" or a \"development impediment\", on the principle that such properties had a negative impact upon surrounding property owners, but was later expanded to allow the taking of any private property when the new third-party owner could develop the property in such a way as to bring in increased tax revenues to the government.\nSome jurisdictions require that the taker make an offer to purchase the subject property, before resorting to the use of eminent domain. However, once the property is taken and the judgment is final, the condemnor owns it in fee simple, and may put it to uses other than those specified in the eminent domain action.\nTakings may be of the subject property in its entirety (total take) or in part (part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in fee simple or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full fee simple title).\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Singapore: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Rail transport (also known as train transport) is a means of transport that transfers passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails, which are incorporated in tracks. In contrast to road transport, where the vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails.\n\nRolling stock in a rail transport system generally encounters lower frictional resistance than rubber-tyred road vehicles, so passenger and freight cars (carriages and wagons) can be coupled into longer trains. The operation is carried out by a railway company, providing transport between train stations or freight customer facilities. Power is provided by locomotives which either draw electric power from a railway electrification system or produce their own power, usually by diesel engines or, historically, steam engines. Most tracks are accompanied by a signalling system. Railways are a safe land transport system when compared to other forms of transport. Railway transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilisation and energy efficiency, but is often less flexible and more capital-intensive than road transport, when lower traffic levels are considered.\nThe oldest known, man/animal-hauled railways date back to the 6th century BC in Corinth, Greece. Rail transport resumed in mid 16th century in Germany in the form of horse-powered funiculars and wagonways. Modern rail transport began with the British development of the steam locomotive in Merthyr Tydfil when Richard Trevithick used a steam locomotive in 1802.  Built by George Stephenson, the Locomotion No. 1 is the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line, the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825.  George Stephenson also built the first public inter-city railway line, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830.  With steam engines, one could construct mainline railways, a key component of the Industrial Revolution. Railways reduced the costs of shipping, and allowed for fewer lost goods, compared with water transport, which faced occasional sinking of ships. The change from canals to railways allowed for \"national markets\" in which prices varied little from city to city.  The use of railway timetables led to standard railway time replacing local mean time.  The invention and development of the railway in the United Kingdom was one of the most important technological inventions of the 19th century. The world's first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway (part of the London Underground), opened in 1863.\nIn the 1880s, electrified trains were introduced, leading to electrification of tramways and rapid transit systems. Starting during the 1940s, the non-electrified railways in most countries had their steam locomotives replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, with the process being almost complete by the 2000s. During the 1960s, electrified high-speed railway systems were introduced in Japan and later in some other countries. Many countries are in the process of replacing diesel locomotives with electric locomotives, mainly due to environmental concerns, a notable example being Switzerland, which has completely electrified its network. Other forms of guided ground transport outside the traditional railway definitions, such as monorail or maglev, have been tried but have seen limited use.\nFollowing a decline after World War II due to competition from cars and aeroplanes, rail transport has had a revival in recent decades due to road congestion and rising fuel prices, as well as governments investing in rail as a means of reducing CO2 emissions in the context of concerns about global warming.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Rolling stock: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_stock@@Railway: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport@@Corinth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth@@Greece: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece@@Germany: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany@@Merthyr Tydfil: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merthyr_Tydfil@@Richard Trevithick: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Trevithick@@George Stephenson: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephenson@@Locomotion No. 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotion_No._1@@Stockton and Darlington Railway: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockton_and_Darlington_Railway@@Liverpool and Manchester Railway: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway@@Industrial Revolution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution@@United Kingdom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom@@Metropolitan Railway: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Railway@@London Underground: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground@@Japan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan@@Switzerland: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland@@World War II: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II@@CO2 emissions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "An abutter is a person (or entity) whose property is adjacent to the property of another. In jurisdictions such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Nova Scotia, it is a defined legal term. Some  jurisdictions, such as Virginia, may use the term adjacent landowner, while others, such as California, use the term adjoining landowner, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency defines rights of contiguous property owners (CPO).\nIn land use regulations, concerns of an abutter may be given special attention, being the one most likely to suffer specific harm from a hasty, uninformed decision. For example, a developer requesting a subdivision may be required to notify (or pay to notify) all abutters of the proposal and invite them to a public hearing. Regulations may also provide an abutter with the right to be heard at the hearing, unlike others who must request permission to be heard, at the discretion of the board.\nIn the spirit of land use politics, even the unified voices of the concerned abutters may sound only faintly against the machinery of \"progress\" or well-funded special interests. However, the courts will objectively consider a proper case brought by an abutter whose rights have been arguably under-appreciated.  Generally, the more abutters interested in a project, the more likely someone will object to it. \nSome regulations otherwise expand or limit the participation of local owners, as where notice may be required for \"anyone whose property is within 200 feet of any point of the parcel under consideration.\"  Another expansive definition would include those whose properties are across a public way or flowing waterway, where the parcels do not actually touch. Contrarily, regulations may define \"abutter\" to include only those people who hold record title to an adjacent parcel, thus undermining the rights of tenants, associations and partial owners (e.g., mineral rights and easement owners) to be notified, let alone heard on a proposal. This would also eliminate participation of owners of unrecorded title, such as adverse possession or those who have simply failed to record a deed or settle an estate involving the adjacent property.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Massachusetts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts@@New Hampshire: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire@@Nova Scotia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia@@Virginia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia@@California: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California@@United States Environmental Protection Agency: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Foreclosure is a legal process in which a lender attempts to recover the balance of a loan from a borrower who has stopped making payments to the lender by forcing the sale of the asset used as the collateral for the loan.Formally, a mortgage lender (mortgagee), or other lienholder, obtains a termination of a mortgage borrower (mortgagor)'s equitable right of redemption, either by court order or by operation of law (after following a specific statutory procedure).Usually, a lender obtains a security interest from a borrower who mortgages or pledges an asset like a house to secure the loan. If the borrower defaults and the lender tries to repossess the property, courts of equity can grant the borrower the equitable right of redemption if the borrower repays the debt. While this equitable right exists, it is a cloud on title and the lender cannot be sure that they can repossess the property. Therefore, through the process of foreclosure, the lender seeks to immediately terminate the equitable right of redemption and take both legal and equitable title to the property in fee simple. Other lien holders can also foreclose the owner's right of redemption for other debts, such as for overdue taxes, unpaid contractors' bills or overdue homeowner association dues or assessments.\nThe foreclosure process as applied to residential mortgage loans is a bank or other secured creditor selling or repossessing a parcel of real property after the owner has failed to comply with an agreement between the lender and borrower called a \"mortgage\" or \"deed of trust\". Commonly, the violation of the mortgage is a default in payment of a promissory note, secured by a lien on the property. When the process is complete, the lender can sell the property and keep the proceeds to pay off its mortgage and any legal costs, and it is typically said that \"the lender has foreclosed its mortgage or lien\". If the promissory note was made with a recourse clause and if the sale does not bring enough to pay the existing balance of principal and fees, then the mortgagee can file a claim for a deficiency judgment. In many states in the United States, items included to calculate the amount of a deficiency judgment include the loan principal, accrued interest and attorney fees less the amount the lender bid at the foreclosure sale.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "A conditional sale is a real estate transaction where the parties have set conditions.A standard real estate transaction usually begins when a prospective purchaser submits an offer to purchase to the vendor of a property. As in a standard offer, a conditional offer sets out the terms of the sale such as the purchase price, the date of closing, the names of the parties, and the amount of any required deposit, but it also stipulates various conditions which must be met in order for the contract to be binding on the parties. These conditions may include approval by a co-purchaser, financing acceptable to the purchaser, the receipt and review of a survey showing that the buildings on the property comply with local zoning regulations, a title search showing no unacceptable liens or encumbrances, confirmation from the current mortgagee that the property is not in foreclosure, and the like. If the offer is accepted by the vendor, the offer to purchase will become a contract binding on the parties when all conditions are satisfied.\nAn alternative to a conditional sale is an invitation to treat. Unlike a conditional sale, an invitation to treat does not become binding upon satisfaction of any conditions. Issues arise as to the distinction between actions which constitute an offer or an invitation to treat, especially when the intentions of the parties are not clearly specified at the time.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " \n\n^^^^^\n"}

Another group contends that schools give students a limited and distorted view of their role - that they graduate with a focus on maximizing shareholder value and only a limited understanding of ethical and social considerations essential to business leadership. Such shortcomings may have left business school graduates inadequately prepared to make the decisions that, taken together, might have helped mitigate the financial and real estate crisis, critics say.

{"prompt": "John Henley Heathcote-Williams (15 November 1941 \u2013 1 July 2017), known as Heathcote Williams, was an English poet, actor, political activist and dramatist. He wrote a number of book-length polemical poems including Autogeddon, Falling for a Dolphin and Whale Nation, which in 1988 was described by Philip Hoare as \"the most powerful argument for the newly instigated worldwide ban on whaling.\" Williams invented his idiosyncratic \"documentary/investigative poetry\" style which he put to good purpose bringing a diverse range of environmental and political matters to public attention. His last published work, American Porn was a critique of the American political establishment and the election of President Donald Trump; its publication date was the day of Trump's inauguration (20 January 2017). In June 2015 he published a book-length investigative poem about the \"Muslim Gandhi\", Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Badshah Khan.As well as being a playwright and screenwriter, Williams appeared in a number of independent and Hollywood films and was among the celebrity guests in the last episode of season 4 of Friends, '\"The One With Ross's Wedding\"'. He played Prospero in Derek Jarman's The Tempest (1979) and appeared in several \"arthouse\" films, including Orlando (1992), as well as the Hollywood film Basic Instinct 2 (2006). Al Pacino played the part of a Williams fan in a spoof arts documentary, Every Time I Cross the Tamar I Get into Trouble. Williams also wrote lyrics, collaborating with Marianne Faithfull among others.\nWilliams was a keen naturalist and discovered a new species of honey-producing wasp in the Argentine pampas, an event he recorded in a book of poems called Forbidden Fruit. Williams was a magician and a member of The Magic Circle. He wrote a TV play called What the Dickens! about Charles Dickens's penchant for performing magic shows. Bob Hoskins taught him fire eating. When he went to demonstrate his newfound talent to then girlfriend Jean Shrimpton, he accidentally set himself alight on her doorstep.\nWilliams was a leading activist in the London squatting scene in the 1970s and ran a squatters \"estate agency\" called the \"Ruff Tuff Cream Puff\". In 1977 he and a couple of hundred fellow squatters established the \"state\" of Frestonia in Notting Hill and declared independence from Britain. The then Shadow Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, wrote to express his support and Williams was appointed UK Ambassador. Frestonia lasted almost a decade and had its own institutions and postage stamps.\nWilliams spray-painted graffiti on the walls of Buckingham Palace as a protest against the Queen signing Michael X's death warrant while there was no capital punishment in the UK. In the early 1970s, his agitational graffiti were a feature on the walls of the then low-rent end of London's Notting Hill district. The final paragraph of Williams' New York Times obituary summed up his philosophy: \"If poetry isn't revolutionary, it's nothing,\" he told Saira Viola from the web publication Gonzo Today in 2015. \"Poetry is heightened language, and language exists to effect change, not to be a tranquilizer.\"\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Autogeddon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogeddon@@Philip Hoare: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hoare@@Donald Trump: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump@@Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Ghaffar_Khan@@Friends: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends@@Prospero: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospero@@Derek Jarman: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jarman@@Basic Instinct 2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Instinct_2@@Al Pacino: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino@@Marianne Faithfull: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Faithfull@@Charles Dickens: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens@@Bob Hoskins: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hoskins@@Jean Shrimpton: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Shrimpton@@Frestonia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frestonia@@Notting Hill: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notting_Hill@@Geoffrey Howe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Howe@@UK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom@@Buckingham Palace: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace@@Michael X: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_X@@New York Times: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Social ownership is the appropriation of the surplus product, produced by the means of production, or the wealth that comes from it, to society as a whole. It is the defining characteristic of a socialist economic system. It can take the form of community ownership, state ownership, common ownership, employee ownership, cooperative ownership, and citizen ownership of equity. Traditionally, social ownership implied that capital and factor markets would cease to exist under the assumption that market exchanges within the production process would be made redundant if capital goods were owned and integrated by a single entity or network of entities representing society; but the articulation of models of market socialism where factor markets are utilized for allocating capital goods between socially owned enterprises broadened the definition to include autonomous entities within a market economy. Social ownership of the means of production is the common defining characteristic of all the various forms of socialism.The two major forms of social ownership are society-wide public ownership and cooperative ownership. The distinction between these two forms lies in the distribution of the surplus product. With society-wide public ownership, the surplus is distributed to all members of the public through a social dividend whereas with co-operative ownership the economic surplus of an enterprise is controlled by all the worker-members of that specific enterprise.The goal of social ownership is to eliminate the distinction between the class of private owners who are the recipients of passive property income and workers who are the recipients of labor income (wages, salaries and commissions), so that the surplus product (or economic profits in the case of market socialism) belong either to society as a whole or to the members of a given enterprise. Social ownership would enable productivity gains from labor automation to progressively reduce the average length of the working day instead of creating job insecurity and unemployment. Reduction of necessary work time is central to the Marxist concept of human freedom and overcoming alienation, a concept widely shared by Marxist and non-Marxist socialists alike.Socialization as a process is the restructuring the economic framework, organizational structure and institutions of an economy on a socialist basis. The comprehensive notion of socialization and the public ownership form of social ownership implies an end to the operation of the laws of capitalism, capital accumulation and the use of money and financial valuation in the production process, along with a restructuring of workplace-level organization.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Socialization as a process: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_ownership\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Marxist humanism is an international body of thought and political action rooted in a humanist interpretation of the works of Karl Marx. It is an investigation into \"what human nature consists of and what sort of society would be most conducive to human thriving\" from a critical perspective rooted in Marxist philosophy. Marxist humanists argue that Marx himself was concerned with investigating similar questions.Marxist humanism was born in 1932 with the publication of Marx's Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 and reached a degree of prominence in the 1950s and 1960s. Marxist humanists contend that there is continuity between the early philosophical writings of Marx, in which he develops his theory of alienation, and the structural description of capitalist society found in his later works such as Capital. They hold that it is necessary to grasp Marx's philosophical foundations to understand his later works properly.Contrary to the official dialectical materialism of the Soviet Union and to interpretations of Marx rooted in the structural Marxism of Louis Althusser, Marxist humanists argue that Marx's work was an extension or transcendence of enlightenment humanism.

Some of these are used only regionally. In the United States and other countries, cul-de-sac is often not an exact synonym for dead end and refers to dead ends with a circular end, allowing for easy turning at the end of the road. In Australia and Canada, they are usually referred to as a court when they have a bulbous end.\nDead ends are added to road layouts in urban planning to limit through-traffic in residential areas. While some dead ends provide no possible passage except in and out of their road entry, others allow cyclists, pedestrians or other non-automotive traffic to pass through connecting easements or paths, an example of filtered permeability. The International Federation of Pedestrians proposed to call such streets \"living end streets\" and to provide signage at the entry of the streets that make this permeability for pedestrians and cyclists clear. Its application retains the dead end's primary function as a non-through road, but establishes complete pedestrian and bicycle network connectivity.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States@@Canada: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada@@International Federation of Pedestrians: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Pedestrians\n\n^^^^^\n"}

This may involve restructuring market incentives or using mathematical methods such as intertemporal optimization for project analysis, or it may involve a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. Common topics include growth theory, poverty and inequality, human capital, and institutions.Unlike in many other fields of economics, approaches in development economics may incorporate social and political factors to devise particular plans.

As of 2012, the branch has served 74,651 passengers every weekday. The Loop is so named because the elevated tracks loop around a rectangle formed by Lake Street (north side), Wabash Avenue (east), Van Buren Street (south), and Wells Street (west). The railway loop has given its name to Chicago's downtown, which is also known as the Loop.\nTransit began to appear in Chicago in the latter half of the 19th century as the city grew rapidly, and rapid transit started to be built in the late 1880s. When the first rapid transit lines opened in the 1890s, they were independently owned and each had terminals that were located immediately outside of Chicago's downtown, where it was considered too expensive and politically inexpedient to build rapid transit. Charles Tyson Yerkes aggregated the competing rapid transit lines and built a loop connecting them, which was constructed and opened in piecemeal fashion between 1895 and 1897, finally completing its last connection in 1900. Upon its completion ridership on the Loop was incredibly high, such that the lines that had closed their terminals outside of downtown had to reopen them to accommodate the surplus rush-hour traffic.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, ridership declined and the Loop was threatened with demolition in the 1970s. However, interest in historic preservation increased in the 1980s, and ridership has stabilized since.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Chicago: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago@@United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States@@Charles Tyson Yerkes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Yerkes\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "A steam locomotive is a locomotive that provides the force to move itself and other vehicles by means of the expansion of steam.:\u200a80\u200a It is fuelled by burning combustible material (usually coal, oil or, rarely, wood) to heat water in the locomotive's boiler to the point where it becomes gaseous and its volume increases 1,700 times. Functionally, it is a steam engine on wheels.\nIn most locomotives, the steam is admitted alternately to each end of its cylinders in which pistons are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels.  Fuel and water supplies are usually carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in a tender coupled to it. Variations in this general design include electrically-powered boilers, turbines in place of pistons, and using steam generated externally.\nSteam locomotives were first developed in the United Kingdom during the early 19th century and used for railway transport until the middle of the 20th century. Richard Trevithick built the first steam locomotive known to have hauled a load over  a distance at Pen-y-darren in 1804, although he produced an earlier locomotive for trial at Coalbrookdale in 1802. Salamanca, built in 1812 by Matthew Murray for the Middleton Railway, was the first commercially successful steam locomotive. Locomotion No. 1, built by George Stephenson and his son Robert\u2019s company Robert Stephenson and Company, was the first steam locomotive to haul passengers on a public railway, the Stockton and Darlington Railway, in 1825. Rapid development ensued; in 1830 George Stephenson opened the first public inter-city railway, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, after the success of Rocket at the 1829 Rainhill Trials had proved that steam locomotives could perform such duties. Robert Stephenson and Company was the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives in the first decades of steam for railways in the United Kingdom, the United States, and much of Europe.Towards the end of the steam era, a longstanding British emphasis on speed culminated in a record, still unbroken, of 126 miles per hour (203 kilometres per hour) by LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard. In the United States, larger loading gauges allowed the development of very large, heavy locomotives such as the Union Pacific Big Boy, which weighed 540 long tons (550 t; 600 short tons) and had a tractive effort of 135,375 pounds-force (602,180 newtons).From the early 1900s, steam locomotives were gradually superseded by electric and diesel locomotives, with railways fully converting to electric and diesel power beginning in the late 1930s. The majority of steam locomotives were retired from regular service by the 1980s, although several continue to run on tourist and heritage lines.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Steam: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam@@Richard Trevithick: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Trevithick@@Pen-y-darren: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penydarren@@Coalbrookdale: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalbrookdale@@Matthew Murray: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Murray@@Middleton Railway: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleton_Railway@@Locomotion No. 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotion_No._1@@George Stephenson: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephenson@@Robert Stephenson and Company: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stephenson_and_Company@@Stockton and Darlington Railway: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockton_and_Darlington_Railway@@Liverpool and Manchester Railway: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway@@Rainhill Trials: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainhill_trials@@LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNER_Class_A4_4468_Mallard@@Union Pacific Big Boy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Pacific_Big_Boy\n\n^^^^^\n"}

{"prompt": "Papua is a province of Indonesia, comprising the northern coast of Western New Guinea together with island groups in Cenderawasih Bay to the west. It roughly follows the borders of Papuan customary region of Tabi Saireri. It is bordered by the sovereign state of Papua New Guinea to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the north, Cenderawasih Bay to the west, and the provinces of Central Papua and Highland Papua to the south. The province also shares maritime boundaries with Palau in the Pacific. Following the splitting off of twenty regencies to create the three new provinces of Central Papua, Highland Papua, and South Papua on 30 June 2022, the residual province is divided into eight regencies (kabupaten) and one city (kota), the latter being the provincial capital of Jayapura. The province has a large potential in natural resources, such as gold, nickel, petroleum, etc. Papua, along with five other Papuan provinces, has a higher degree of autonomy level compared to other Indonesian provinces.The island of New Guinea has been populated for tens of thousands of years.  European traders began frequenting the region around the late 16th century due to spice trade. In the end, the Dutch Empire emerged as the dominant leader in the spice war, annexing the western part of New Guinea into the colony of Dutch East Indies. The Dutch remained in New Guinea until 1962, even though other parts of the former colony has declared independence as the Republic of Indonesia in 1945. Following negotiations and conflicts with the Indonesian government, the Dutch transferred Western New Guinea to a United Nations Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA), which was again transferred to Indonesia after the controversial Act of Free Choice. The province was formerly called Irian Jaya and comprised the entire Western New Guinea until the inauguration of the province of West Papua (then West Irian Jaya) in 2001. In 2002, Papua adopted its current name and was granted a special autonomous status under Indonesian legislation.\nThe province of Papua remains one of the least developed provinces in Indonesia. As of 2020, Papua has a GDP per capita of Rp 56.1 million (US$ 3,970), ranking 11th place among all Indonesian provinces. However, Papua only has a Human Development Index of 0.604, the lowest among all Indonesian provinces. The harsh New Guinean terrain and climate is one of the main reasons why infrastructure in Papua is considered to be the most challenging to be developed among other Indonesian regions.The 2020 Census revealed a population of 4,303,707, of which the majority were Christian. The official estimate for mid 2022 was 4,418,581 prior to the division of the province into four separate provinces. The official estimate of the population in mid 2022 of the reduced province was 1,034,956. The interior is predominantly populated by ethnic Papuans while coastal towns are inhabited by descendants of intermarriages between Papuans, Melanesians and Austronesians, including the Indonesian ethnic groups. Migrants from the rest of Indonesia also tend to inhabit the coastal regions.

{"prompt": "Jacob Le Maire (c. 1585 \u2013 22 December 1616) was a Dutch mariner who circumnavigated the earth in 1615 and 1616. The strait between Tierra del Fuego and Isla de los Estados was named the Le Maire Strait in his honour, though not without controversy. It was Le Maire himself who proposed to the council aboard Eendracht that the new passage should be called by his name and the council unanimously agreed with Le Maire. The author or authors of The Relation took Eendracht captain Willem Schouten's side by proclaiming:\n\n\u201c ... our men had each of them three cups of wine in signe of ioy for our good hap ...

{"prompt": "The New Order (Indonesian: Orde Baru, abbreviated Orba) is the term coined by the second Indonesian President Suharto to characterise his administration as he came to power in 1966 until his resignation in 1998. Suharto used this term to contrast his presidency with that of his predecessor Sukarno (retroactively dubbed the \"Old Order,\" or Orde Lama).\nImmediately following the attempted coup in 1965, the political situation was uncertain, Suharto's New Order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from Indonesia's problems since its independence. The 'generation of 66' (Angkatan 66) epitomised talk of a new group of young leaders and new intellectual thought. Following Indonesia's communal and political conflicts, and its economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s,  the \"New Order\" was committed to achieving and maintaining political order, economic development, and the removal of mass participation in the political process. The features of the \"New Order\" established from the late 1960s were thus a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of political and societal organisations, and selective but brutal repression of opponents. Strident anti-communist, anti-socialist, and anti-Islamist doctrine remained a hallmark of the presidency for its subsequent 30 years.\nWithin a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the 1998 Indonesian Revolution and then gained power, the term \"New Order\" has come to be used pejoratively. It is frequently employed to describe figures who were either tied to the Suharto period, or who upheld the practises of his authoritarian administration, such as corruption, collusion and nepotism (widely known by the acronym KKN: korupsi, kolusi, nepotisme).\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Suharto: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto@@Sukarno: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukarno@@Indonesia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia@@Angkatan 66: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkatan_66@@1998 Indonesian Revolution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Suharto\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "Short Message/Messaging Service, commonly abbreviated as SMS, is a text messaging service component of most telephone, Internet and mobile device systems. It uses standardized communication protocols that let mobile devices exchange short text messages. An intermediary service can facilitate a text-to-voice conversion to be sent to landlines.SMS technology originated from radio telegraphy in radio memo pagers that used standardized phone protocols. These were defined in 1986 as part of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) series of standards. The first SMS message was sent on 3 December 1992, when Neil Papworth, a test engineer for Sema Group, sent \"Merry Christmas\" to the Orbitel 901 phone of colleague Richard Jarvis. SMS rolled out commercially on many cellular networks that decade and became hugely popular worldwide as a method of text communication. By the end of 2010, SMS was the most widely used data application, with an estimated 3.5 billion active users, or about 80% of all mobile phone subscribers.\nThe service allows users to send and receive messages of up to 160 characters (when entirely alpha-numeric) to and from GSM mobiles. Although most SMS messages are sent from one mobile phone to another, support for the service has expanded to include other mobile technologies, such as CDMA networks and Digital AMPS.Mobile marketing, a type of direct marketing, uses SMS. The global SMS messaging business was estimated to be worth over US$240 billion in 2013, accounting for almost half of all revenue generated by mobile messaging.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Internet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet@@GSM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM@@Neil Papworth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Papworth@@Sema Group: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sema_Group@@Digital AMPS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_AMPS@@Mobile marketing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_marketing\n\n^^^^^\n"}
{"prompt": "Abdurrahman Wahid ( (listen) AHB-doo-RAHKH-mahn wah-HEED; born Abdurrahman ad-Dakhil; 7 September 1940 \u2013 30 December 2009), though more colloquially known as Gus Dur (listen ), was an Indonesian politician and Islamic religious leader who served as the 4th president of Indonesia, from his election in 1999 until his removal from power in 2001.  A long time leader within the Nahdlatul Ulama organization, he was the founder of the National Awakening Party (PKB). He was the son of Minister of Religious Affairs Wahid Hasyim, and the grandson of Nahdatul Ulama founder Hasyim Asy'ari. He had a visual impairment caused by glaucoma; he was blind on the left eye and partially blind on his right eye. He was the first and as of 2022 the only president of Indonesia to have had physical disabilities.\nWahid was instrumental in uplifting the ban on Imlek. Until 1998, the spiritual practice to celebrate the Chinese New Year by Chinese families was restricted specifically only inside of the Chinese house. This restriction is made by the New Order government through a Presidential Instruction No. 14 of 1967 signed by President Suharto. On 17 January 2000, the President Abdurrahman Wahid issued Presidential Decree No. 6 of 2000 to annul the previous instruction.  He was also the one who established Confucianism as the sixth official religion in Indonesia in 2000 and the one who protected minority rights in Indonesia. As a result he was given the title \"Father of Pluralism\".His popular nickname 'Gus Dur' is derived from Gus, a common honorific for a son of kyai, and from the short-form of bagus ('handsome lad' in Javanese); and Dur, short-form of his name, Abdurrahman.\n\n%%%%%\n", "completion": " Nahdlatul Ulama: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahdlatul_Ulama@@National Awakening Party: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Awakening_Party@@Wahid Hasyim: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahid_Hasyim@@Nahdatul Ulama: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahdlatul_Ulama@@Hasyim Asy'ari: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasyim_Asy%27ari@@Chinese New Year: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year@@Suharto: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto\n\n^^^^^\n"}
