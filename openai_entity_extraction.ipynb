We can of course take the manual route and classify/tag our content one by one. We can also explore recent advances uses large language models, and training them for the specific task of extracting certain data from our pages, and creating the desired additional markup in the form of JSON-LD scripts. But we are not restricted to that format, once we have access to the data, we can format it any way we want.\n",

    "It's quite an ambitious goal to automate the process of extracting entities, and not only that, we will also get their respective Wikipedia URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have those URLs, it becomes easier to get more information about each entity, as we can scrape that page, search Google, and so on. But we first need that initial starting page. We won't go beyond that step in this article, and we will focus on the process up to this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started with coding, let's first make a distinction between normal prompting, and fine-tuned models. Regular prompts are simple instructions or questions, instructing the model to complete a certain task, answer a question, or create some content. It aims to be a universal question/answer machine that can function as your personal assistant. When we fine-tune a model on the other hand, we are training the LLM for a particular task which it will perform much better than a regular prompt, with the limitation of knowing how to perform that task only. It's kind of like the difference between a regular car (normal prompting) and a metro train (fine-tuned models). Your car can be used for various tasks, and can satisfy almost all our transportation needs. A metro train can only do one thing, go from point A to point B and back. It is very limited, but it performs this task extremely well, way better than a car, and on a much larger scale. Here is a quick comparison between these two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Area | Normal prompting | Fine-tuned model\n",
    "-----|------------------|------------------\n",
    "Scope| General          | Specific\n",
    "Training process | Included in prompt | Done by providing many similar consistent examples\n",
    "Generality | Jack of all trades | Very specific tool\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You have probably already experimented with normal prompts, and for the above task, is would be something like the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Extract the main entities of the following text, and provide the Wikipedia URL for each, format the response as a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "FULL TEXT GOES HERE\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These days you are stuck with a paradoxical situation here, which arises from the limitations on prompt length. If you want to get a good response, you need to provide a very detailed prompt with examples, and clear instructions. But the more examples and instructions you provide, the less space you have to provide the content that needs to be processed. The opposite is also true. With a fine tuned model, you only send a piece of text which will function as the prompt. Our trained model will not think about it, or try anything else other than what it was trained for (the above task).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly go through a simple process of training the LLM with a fine-tuned model: \n",
    "\n",
    "prompt | response\n",
    "-------|---------\n",
    "blue   | be\n",
    "flower | fr\n",
    "book   | bk\n",
    "sea    | sa\n",
    "window | ww\n",
    "car    | cr\n",
    "bag    | `??`\n",
    "\n",
    "Having gone through the examples above, it was probably easy for you to figure out how to complete the last prompt \"bag\", because the examples before it were consistent and clear. Each response has only two letters, and when related to its respective prompt, you can clearly see that it is basically the first and last characters of that prompt. The more examples we provide, the more confident you would be that this is indeed the pattern we are after. The key here then, is to provide numerous, clear, and most importantly, consistent prompt:response pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly how we will train ChatGPT to extract the required entities. Our \"prompt\" will simply be an article and it will figure out what to do with it (provided we did a good job in the training phase).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, our prompts are going to be extremely easy. They would not contain any instructions or clarifications. But the difficulty is in providing a large-enough number of examples where the LLM would be able to clearly get the pattern we are after.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Training Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to provide a dataset with the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A large number of articles (hundreds)\n",
    "- Those articles need to have entities identitied and extracted from them by humans\n",
    "- Not only do we want to get the entities, we need each entity's Wikipedia URL as well\n",
    "\n",
    "Where might we find such a dataset? On Wikipedia itself. It satisfies all those conditions. That was easy. Now the implementation. Fortunately, the Wikipedia API provides a few convenient features to make our job easier. For each article we can download the text along with various interesting elements. We will focus on two of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summary:** This is the first few paragraphs that we see at the beginning of each article.\n",
    "- **Links:** A list of all links in the article.\n",

       "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.\n",
       "Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.\n",
       "The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.\n",

      "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.\n",
      "Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.\n",
      "The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.\n",
      "Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition (drawing most of its talent from U.S. college basketball). Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup.\n",
      "The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships. The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.\n",
